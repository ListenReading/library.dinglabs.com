THOUGHT AND CHARACTER
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="23.339" endTime="44.403">
<Sync time="23.339"/>
THE aphorism, 
<Sync time="24.535"/>
"As a man thinketh in his heart 
<Sync time="26.472"/>
so is he," 
<Sync time="27.682"/>
not only embraces the whole of a man's being, 
<Sync time="30.585"/>
but is so comprehensive 
<Sync time="32.438"/>
as to reach out to every condition and circumstance of his life. 
<Sync time="37.324"/>
A man is literally what he thinks, 
<Sync time="39.741"/>
his character being the complete sum 
<Sync time="41.999"/>
of all his thoughts.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="44.403" endTime="64.03">
<Sync time="44.403"/>
As the plant springs from, 
<Sync time="46.133"/>
and could not be without, the seed, 
<Sync time="48.377"/>
so every act of a man springs from the hidden seeds of thought, 
<Sync time="52.494"/>
and could not have appeared without them. 
<Sync time="55.145"/>
This applies equally to those acts called "spontaneous" and "unpremeditated" 
<Sync time="60.212"/>
as to those, which are deliberately executed.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="64.03" endTime="75.077">
<Sync time="64.03"/>
Act is the blossom of thought, 
<Sync time="66.073"/>
and joy and suffering are its fruits; 
<Sync time="69.291"/>
thus does a man garner in the sweet and bitter fruitage 
<Sync time="72.585"/>
of his own husbandry.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="75.077" endTime="95.268">
<Sync time="75.077"/>
"Thought in the mind hath made us, 
<Sync time="77.42"/>
What we are
<Sync time="78.58"/>
By thought was wrought and built. 
<Sync time="81.019"/>
If a man's mind
Hath evil thoughts, 
<Sync time="83.722"/>
pain comes on him as comes
The wheel the ox behind....
<Sync time="87.615"/>
..If one endure
In purity of thought, 
<Sync time="90.398"/>
joy follows him
As his own shadow—sure."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="95.268" endTime="131.34">
<Sync time="95.268"/>
Man is a growth by law, 
<Sync time="96.986"/>
and not a creation by artifice, 
<Sync time="99.205"/>
and cause and effect 
<Sync time="100.315"/>
is as absolute and undeviating in the hidden realm of thought 
<Sync time="104.239"/>
as in the world of visible and material things. 
<Sync time="107.929"/>
A noble and Godlike character 
<Sync time="110.081"/>
is not a thing of favour or chance, 
<Sync time="112.6"/>
but is the natural result of continued effort in right thinking, 
<Sync time="117.082"/>
the effect of long-cherished association with Godlike thoughts. 
<Sync time="121.908"/>
An ignoble and bestial character, 
<Sync time="124.201"/>
by the same process, 
<Sync time="126.131"/>
is the result of the continued harbouring 
<Sync time="128.637"/>
of grovelling thoughts.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="131.34" endTime="166.342">
<Sync time="131.34"/>
Man is made or unmade by himself; 
<Sync time="134.513"/>
in the armoury of thought 
<Sync time="136.334"/>
he forges the weapons by which he destroys himself; 
<Sync time="139.711"/>
he also fashions the tools with which he builds for himself 
<Sync time="143.669"/>
heavenly mansions of joy and strength and peace. 
<Sync time="147.765"/>
By the right choice and true application of thought, 
<Sync time="150.631"/>
man ascends to the Divine Perfection; 
<Sync time="153.522"/>
by the abuse and wrong application of thought, 
<Sync time="156.303"/>
he descends below the level of the beast. 
<Sync time="159.285"/>
Between these two extremes are all the grades of character, 
<Sync time="162.855"/>
and man is their maker and master.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="166.342" endTime="185.575">
<Sync time="166.342"/>
Of all the beautiful truths pertaining to the soul which have been restored and brought to light in this age, 
<Sync time="171.913"/>
none is more gladdening or fruitful of divine promise and confidence than this—
<Sync time="176.678"/>
that man is the master of thought, 
<Sync time="178.924"/>
the moulder of character, 
<Sync time="180.381"/>
and the maker and shaper of condition, 
<Sync time="182.619"/>
environment, 
<Sync time="183.414"/>
and destiny.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="185.575" endTime="202.511">
<Sync time="185.575"/>
As a being of Power, 
<Sync time="187.244"/>
Intelligence, 
<Sync time="188.355"/>
and Love, 
<Sync time="189.23"/>
and the lord of his own thoughts, 
<Sync time="191.206"/>
man holds the key to every situation, 
<Sync time="193.89"/>
and contains within himself that transforming 
<Sync time="196.636"/>
and regenerative agency by which he may make himself what he wills.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="202.511" endTime="245.213">
<Sync time="202.511"/>
Man is always the master, 
<Sync time="204.461"/>
even in his weaker and most abandoned state; 
<Sync time="208.33"/>
but in his weakness and degradation 
<Sync time="211.023"/>
he is the foolish master who misgoverns his "household." 
<Sync time="215.032"/>
When he begins to reflect upon his condition, 
<Sync time="217.709"/>
and to search diligently for the Law upon which his being is established, 
<Sync time="222.333"/>
he then becomes the wise master, 
<Sync time="224.555"/>
directing his energies with intelligence, 
<Sync time="226.964"/>
and fashioning his thoughts to fruitful issues. 
<Sync time="230.65"/>
Such is the conscious master, 
<Sync time="232.89"/>
and man can only thus become by discovering 
<Sync time="235.738"/>
within himself 
<Sync time="236.989"/>
the laws of thought; 
<Sync time="238.675"/>
which discovery is totally a matter of application, 
<Sync time="241.727"/>
self analysis, 
<Sync time="243.127"/>
and experience.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="245.213" endTime="310.961632653">
<Sync time="245.213"/>
Only by much searching and mining, 
<Sync time="247.424"/>
are gold and diamonds obtained, 
<Sync time="249.479"/>
and man can find every truth connected with his being, 
<Sync time="252.555"/>
if he will dig deep into the mine of his soul; 
<Sync time="256.059"/>
and that he is the maker of his character, 
<Sync time="258.378"/>
the moulder of his life, 
<Sync time="260.006"/>
and the builder of his destiny, 
<Sync time="261.808"/>
he may unerringly prove, 
<Sync time="264.047"/>
if he will watch, 
<Sync time="265.407"/>
control, 
<Sync time="266.131"/>
and alter his thoughts, 
<Sync time="267.742"/>
tracing their effects upon himself, 
<Sync time="270.033"/>
upon others, 
<Sync time="271.21"/>
and upon his life and circumstances, 
<Sync time="273.806"/>
linking cause and effect by patient practice and investigation, 
<Sync time="278.41"/>
and utilizing his every experience, 
<Sync time="280.583"/>
even to the most trivial, everyday occurrence, 
<Sync time="282.374"/>
as a means of obtaining that knowledge of himself which is Understanding, Wisdom, Power. 
<Sync time="286.334"/>
In this direction, 
<Sync time="287.482"/>
as in no other, 
<Sync time="288.599"/>
is the law absolute that 
<Sync time="290.67"/>
"He that seeketh findeth; 
<Sync time="292.364"/>
and to him that knocketh 
<Sync time="293.815"/>
it shall be opened;" 
<Sync time="295.402"/>
for only by patience, 
<Sync time="296.913"/>
practice, 
<Sync time="297.675"/>
and ceaseless importunity 
<Sync time="299.732"/>
can a man enter the Door of the Temple of Knowledge.
<Sync time="303.23"/>
