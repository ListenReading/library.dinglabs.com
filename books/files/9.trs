SERENITY

<Sync time="23.325"/>
CALMNESS of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom. 
<Sync time="27.048"/>
It is the result of long and patient effort in self-control. 
<Sync time="31.017"/>
Its presence is an indication of ripened experience, 
<Sync time="34.745"/>
and of a more than ordinary knowledge of the laws 
<Sync time="37.647"/>
and operations of thought.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="40.141" endTime="66.295">
<Sync time="40.141"/>
A man becomes calm in the measure that he understands himself as a thought evolved being, 
<Sync time="45.974"/>
for such knowledge necessitates the understanding of others as the result of thought, 
<Sync time="51.688"/>
and as he develops a right understanding, 
<Sync time="53.831"/>
and sees more and more clearly 
<Sync time="55.513"/>
the internal relations of things by the action of cause and effect 
<Sync time="59.641"/>
he ceases to fuss and fume and worry and grieve, 
<Sync time="62.923"/>
and remains poised, 
<Sync time="64.299"/>
steadfast, 
<Sync time="65.255"/>
serene.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="66.295" endTime="98.557">
<Sync time="66.295"/>
The calm man, 
<Sync time="67.571"/>
having learned how to govern himself, 
<Sync time="69.713"/>
knows how to adapt himself to others; 
<Sync time="72.189"/>
and they, 
<Sync time="73.16"/>
in turn, 
<Sync time="74.047"/>
reverence his spiritual strength, 
<Sync time="76.373"/>
and feel that they can learn of him and rely upon him. 
<Sync time="79.745"/>
The more tranquil a man becomes, 
<Sync time="81.706"/>
the greater is his success, 
<Sync time="83.357"/>
his influence, 
<Sync time="84.363"/>
his power for good. 
<Sync time="86.108"/>
Even the ordinary trader will find his business prosperity increase as he develops a greater self-control 
<Sync time="92.298"/>
and equanimity, 
<Sync time="93.448"/>
for people will always prefer to deal with a man whose demeanour is strongly equable.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="98.557" endTime="150.883">
<Sync time="98.557"/>
The strong, calm man is always loved and revered. 
<Sync time="102.222"/>
He is like a shade-giving tree in a thirsty land, 
<Sync time="105.299"/>
or a sheltering rock in a storm. 
<Sync time="107.894"/>
"Who does not love a tranquil heart, 
<Sync time="110.017"/>
a sweet-tempered, 
<Sync time="111.088"/>
balanced life? 
<Sync time="112.178"/>
It does not matter whether it rains or shines, 
<Sync time="114.913"/>
or what changes come to those possessing these blessings, 
<Sync time="118.138"/>
for they are always sweet, 
<Sync time="119.513"/>
serene, 
<Sync time="120.299"/>
and calm. 
<Sync time="121.247"/>
That exquisite poise of character, which we call serenity 
<Sync time="124.636"/>
is the last lesson of culture, 
<Sync time="126.849"/>
the fruitage of the soul. 
<Sync time="130.807"/>
It is precious as wisdom, 
<Sync time="132.684"/>
more to be desired than gold—
<Sync time="135.284"/>
yea, 
<Sync time="136.605"/>
than even fine gold. 
<Sync time="138.743"/>
How insignificant mere money seeking looks in comparison with a serene life—
<Sync time="143.663"/>
a life that dwells in the ocean of Truth, 
<Sync time="145.99"/>
beneath the waves, 
<Sync time="147.204"/>
beyond the reach of tempests, 
<Sync time="148.928"/>
in the Eternal Calm!
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="150.883" endTime="178.352">
<Sync time="150.883"/>
"How many people we know who sour their lives, 
<Sync time="153.544"/>
who ruin all that is sweet and beautiful by explosive tempers, 
<Sync time="157.429"/>
who destroy their poise of character, 
<Sync time="159.368"/>
and make bad blood! 
<Sync time="160.984"/>
It is a question whether 
<Sync time="162.615"/>
the great majority of people do not ruin their lives 
<Sync time="165.551"/>
and mar their happiness 
<Sync time="166.819"/>
by lack of self-control. 
<Sync time="169.806"/>
How few people we meet in life who are well balanced, 
<Sync time="173.324"/>
who have that exquisite poise which is characteristic of the finished character!

Yes, 
<Sync time="179.318"/>
humanity surges with uncontrolled passion, 
<Sync time="182.296"/>
is tumultuous with ungoverned grief, 
<Sync time="185.074"/>
is blown about by anxiety and doubt 
<Sync time="187.769"/>
only the wise man, 
<Sync time="189.21"/>
only he whose thoughts are controlled and purified, 
<Sync time="192.948"/>
makes the winds and the storms of the soul obey him.

Tempest-tossed souls, 
<Sync time="198.812"/>
wherever ye may be, 
<Sync time="200.418"/>
under whatsoever conditions ye may live, 
<Sync time="203.139"/>
know this 
<Sync time="204.383"/>
in the ocean of life the isles of Blessedness are smiling, 
<Sync time="208.282"/>
and the sunny shore of your ideal awaits your coming. 
<Sync time="211.436"/>
Keep your hand firmly upon the helm of thought. 
<Sync time="213.992"/>
In the bark of your soul reclines the commanding Master; 
<Sync time="217.074"/>
He does but sleep: 
<Sync time="218.503"/>
wake Him. 
<Sync time="219.396"/>
Self-control is strength; 
<Sync time="221.62"/>
Right Thought is mastery; 
<Sync time="223.694"/>
Calmness is power. 
<Sync time="225.562"/>
Say unto your heart, 
<Sync time="227.089"/>
"Peace, 
<Sync time="227.81"/>
be still!"
