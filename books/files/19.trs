X — ALICE'S EVIDENCE
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="25.185" endTime="34.826">
<Sync time="25.185"/>
"Here!" 
<Sync time="25.825"/>
cried Alice. 
<Sync time="27.201"/>
She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box, 
<Sync time="30.779"/>
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="34.826" endTime="40.216">
<Sync time="34.826"/>
"Oh, 
<Sync time="35.685"/>
I beg your pardon!" 
<Sync time="36.982"/>
she exclaimed 
<Sync time="37.888"/>
in a tone of great dismay.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="40.216" endTime="51.476">
<Sync time="40.216"/>
"The trial cannot proceed," said the King, 
<Sync time="42.419"/>
"until all the jurymen are back in their proper places—
<Sync time="45.903"/>
all," 
<Sync time="46.888"/>
he repeated 
<Sync time="47.623"/>
with great emphasis, 
<Sync time="48.929"/>
looking hard at Alice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="51.476" endTime="55.194">
<Sync time="51.476"/>
"What do you know about this business?" 
<Sync time="53.257"/>
the King said to Alice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="55.194" endTime="57.601">
<Sync time="55.194"/>
"Nothing whatever," 
<Sync time="56.1"/>
said Alice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="57.601" endTime="65.335">
<Sync time="57.601"/>
The King then read from his book: 
<Sync time="59.663"/>
"Rule forty-two. 
<Sync time="61.319"/>
All persons more than a mile high to leave the court."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="65.335" endTime="68.522">
<Sync time="65.335"/>
"I'm not a mile high," 
<Sync time="66.96"/>
said Alice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="68.522" endTime="71.428">
<Sync time="68.522"/>
"Nearly two miles high," said the Queen.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="71.428" endTime="73.848">
<Sync time="71.428"/>
"Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate," said Alice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="73.848" endTime="74.287">
<Sync time="73.848"/>

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="74.287" endTime="82.272">
<Sync time="74.287"/>
The King turned pale and shut his note-book hastily. 
<Sync time="77.49"/>
"Consider your verdict," he said to the jury, 
<Sync time="79.834"/>
in a low, trembling voice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="82.272" endTime="101.99">
<Sync time="82.272"/>
"There's more evidence to come yet, please Your Majesty," 
<Sync time="84.897"/>
said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry. 
<Sync time="87.304"/>
"This paper has just been picked up. 
<Sync time="89.366"/>
It seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to—
<Sync time="92.646"/>
to somebody." 
<Sync time="94.584"/>
He unfolded the paper as he spoke and added, 
<Sync time="97.553"/>
"It isn't a letter, after all; 
<Sync time="99.646"/>
it's a set of verses."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="101.99" endTime="108.085">
<Sync time="101.99"/>
"Please, Your Majesty," said the Knave, 
<Sync time="103.662"/>
"I didn't write it and they can't prove that I did; 
<Sync time="105.819"/>
there's no name signed at the end."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="108.085" endTime="116.351">
<Sync time="108.085"/>
"You must have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your name like an honest man," 
<Sync time="111.85"/>
said the King. 
<Sync time="113.179"/>
There was a general clapping of hands at this.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="116.351" endTime="120.476">
<Sync time="116.351"/>
"Read them," 
<Sync time="117.024"/>
he added, 
<Sync time="117.929"/>
turning to the White Rabbit.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="120.476" endTime="127.335">
<Sync time="120.476"/>
There was dead silence in the court 
<Sync time="122.429"/>
whilst the White Rabbit read out the verses.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="127.335" endTime="132.492">
<Sync time="127.335"/>
"That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet," 
<Sync time="130.836"/>
said the King.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="132.492" endTime="136.367">
<Sync time="132.492"/>
"I don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it," 
<Sync time="134.617"/>
ventured Alice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="136.367" endTime="143.991">
<Sync time="136.367"/>
"If there's no meaning in it," said the King, "that saves a world of trouble, you know, 
<Sync time="139.851"/>
as we needn't try to find any. 
<Sync time="141.648"/>
Let the jury consider their verdict."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="143.991" endTime="148.132">
<Sync time="143.991"/>
"No, no!" said the Queen. 
<Sync time="145.522"/>
"Sentence first—verdict afterwards."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="148.132" endTime="154.069">
<Sync time="148.132"/>
"Stuff and nonsense!" said Alice loudly. 
<Sync time="150.491"/>
"The idea of having the sentence first!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="154.069" endTime="156.71">
<Sync time="154.069"/>
"Hold your tongue!" said the Queen, turning purple.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="156.71" endTime="158.507">
<Sync time="156.71"/>
"I won't!" said Alice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="158.507" endTime="164.819">
<Sync time="158.507"/>
"Off with her head!" 
<Sync time="159.851"/>
the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. 
<Sync time="163.194"/>
Nobody moved.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="164.819" endTime="171.632">
<Sync time="164.819"/>
"Who cares for you?" said Alice 
<Sync time="166.881"/>
(she had grown to her full size by this time). 
<Sync time="169.569"/>
"You're nothing but a pack of cards!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="171.632" endTime="172.132">
<Sync time="171.632"/>

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="172.132" endTime="193.364">
<Sync time="172.132"/>
At this, 
<Sync time="173.132"/>
the whole pack rose up in the air 
<Sync time="175.053"/>
and came flying down upon her; 
<Sync time="177.256"/>
she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, 
<Sync time="181.6"/>
and found herself 
<Sync time="183.1"/>
lying on the bank, 
<Sync time="184.755"/>
with her head in the lap of her sister, 
<Sync time="187.005"/>
who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees 
<Sync time="191.286"/>
upon her face.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="193.364" endTime="198.379">
<Sync time="193.364"/>
"Wake up, Alice dear!" said her sister. 
<Sync time="195.848"/>
"Why, what a long sleep you've had!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="198.379" endTime="216.064">
<Sync time="198.379"/>
"Oh, I've had such a curious dream!" said Alice. 
<Sync time="201.707"/>
And she told her sister, 
<Sync time="203.191"/>
as well as she could remember them, 
<Sync time="205.003"/>
all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about. 
<Sync time="209.331"/>
Alice got up and ran off, 
<Sync time="211.206"/>
thinking while she ran, 
<Sync time="212.69"/>
as well she might, 
<Sync time="213.941"/>
what a wonderful dream it had been.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="216.064" endTime="228.885">
