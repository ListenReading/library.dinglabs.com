ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="26.89" endTime="34.468">
<Sync time="26.89"/>
At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth 
<Sync time="30.047"/>
and addressed Alice in a languid, 
<Sync time="32.109"/>
sleepy voice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="34.468" endTime="37.078">
<Sync time="34.468"/>
"Who are you?" said the Caterpillar.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="37.078" endTime="38.078">
<Sync time="37.078"/>
i014_th.jpg
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="38.078" endTime="51.436">
<Sync time="38.078"/>
Alice replied, 
<Sync time="39.281"/>
rather shyly, 
<Sync time="40.624"/>
"I—
<Sync time="41.905"/>
I hardly know, sir, just at present—
<Sync time="44.421"/>
at least 
<Sync time="45.202"/>
I know who I was when I got up this morning, 
<Sync time="47.655"/>
but I think I must have changed several times since then."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="51.436" endTime="56.468">
<Sync time="51.436"/>
"What do you mean by that?" said the Caterpillar, sternly. 
<Sync time="54.186"/>
"Explain yourself!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="56.468" endTime="72.829">
<Sync time="56.468"/>
"I can't explain myself, I'm afraid, sir," said Alice, 
<Sync time="59.875"/>
"because I'm not myself, you see—
<Sync time="62.063"/>
being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing." 
<Sync time="66.5"/>
She drew herself up and said very gravely, 
<Sync time="69.094"/>
"I think you ought to tell me who you are, first."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="72.829" endTime="76.001">
<Sync time="72.829"/>
"Why?" 
<Sync time="73.704"/>
said the Caterpillar.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="76.001" endTime="84.095">
<Sync time="76.001"/>
As Alice could not think of any good reason 
<Sync time="78.407"/>
and the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, 
<Sync time="82.376"/>
she turned away.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="84.095" endTime="92.173">
<Sync time="84.095"/>
"Come back!" 
<Sync time="85.174"/>
the Caterpillar called after her. 
<Sync time="86.97"/>
"I've something important to say!" 
<Sync time="89.876"/>
Alice turned and came back again.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="92.173" endTime="95.955">
<Sync time="92.173"/>
"Keep your temper," 
<Sync time="93.439"/>
said the Caterpillar.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="95.955" endTime="101.268">
<Sync time="95.955"/>
"Is that all?" 
<Sync time="96.892"/>
said Alice, 
<Sync time="97.924"/>
swallowing down her anger as well as she could.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="101.268" endTime="103.596">
<Sync time="101.268"/>
"No," 
<Sync time="101.884"/>
said the Caterpillar.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="103.596" endTime="110.472">
<Sync time="103.596"/>
It unfolded its arms, 
<Sync time="105.159"/>
took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 
<Sync time="107.628"/>
"So you think you're changed, do you?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="110.472" endTime="118.239">
<Sync time="110.472"/>
"I'm afraid, I am, sir," said Alice. 
<Sync time="112.613"/>
"I can't remember things as I used—
<Sync time="114.426"/>
and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="118.239" endTime="121.927">
<Sync time="118.239"/>
"What size do you want to be?" 
<Sync time="119.958"/>
asked the Caterpillar.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="121.927" endTime="136.211">
<Sync time="121.927"/>
"Oh, I'm not particular as to size," 
<Sync time="123.646"/>
Alice hastily replied, 
<Sync time="125.318"/>
"only 
<Sync time="126.288"/>
one doesn't like changing so often, you know. 
<Sync time="129.038"/>
I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind," 
<Sync time="131.664"/>
said Alice. 
<Sync time="132.665"/>
"Three inches is such a wretched height to be."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="136.211" endTime="144.618">
<Sync time="136.211"/>
"It is a very good height indeed!" said the Caterpillar 
<Sync time="138.711"/>
angrily, 
<Sync time="139.508"/>
rearing itself upright as it spoke 
<Sync time="141.742"/>
(it was exactly three inches high).
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="144.618" endTime="157.346">
<Sync time="144.618"/>
In a minute or two, 
<Sync time="146.346"/>
the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom 
<Sync time="148.659"/>
and crawled away into the grass, 
<Sync time="150.534"/>
merely remarking, as it went, 
<Sync time="152.612"/>
"One side will make you grow taller, and the other side 
<Sync time="155.22"/>
will make you grow shorter."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="157.346" endTime="162.362">
<Sync time="157.346"/>
"One side of what? 
<Sync time="159.034"/>
The other side of what?" 
<Sync time="160.315"/>
thought Alice to herself.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="162.362" endTime="170.987">
<Sync time="162.362"/>
"Of the mushroom," said the Caterpillar, 
<Sync time="164.518"/>
just as if she had asked it aloud; 
<Sync time="166.706"/>
and in another moment, 
<Sync time="168.019"/>
it was out of sight.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="170.987" endTime="183.754">
<Sync time="170.987"/>
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, 
<Sync time="174.347"/>
trying to make out which were the two sides of it. 
<Sync time="177.268"/>
At last 
<Sync time="177.925"/>
she stretched her arms 'round it as far as they would go, 
<Sync time="180.691"/>
and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="183.754" endTime="197.521">
<Sync time="183.754"/>
"And now 
<Sync time="185.051"/>
which is which?" 
<Sync time="186.269"/>
she said to herself, 
<Sync time="187.644"/>
and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect. 
<Sync time="191.379"/>
The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin—
<Sync time="195.364"/>
it had struck her foot!
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="197.521" endTime="215.131">
<Sync time="197.521"/>
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, 
<Sync time="200.084"/>
as she was shrinking rapidly; 
<Sync time="201.974"/>
so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. 
<Sync time="205.287"/>
Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot 
<Sync time="207.678"/>
that there was hardly room to open her mouth; 
<Sync time="209.834"/>
but she did it at last 
<Sync time="211.303"/>
and managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit....
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="215.131" endTime="228.132">
<Sync time="215.131"/>
"Come, my head's free at last!" said Alice; 
<Sync time="217.366"/>
but all she could see, when she looked down, 
<Sync time="219.929"/>
was an immense length of neck, 
<Sync time="222.319"/>
which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="228.132" endTime="255.042">
<Sync time="228.132"/>
"Where have my shoulders got to? 
<Sync time="230.163"/>
And oh, my poor hands, 
<Sync time="232.616"/>
how is it I can't see you?" 
<Sync time="235.147"/>
She was delighted to find 
<Sync time="236.819"/>
that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. 
<Sync time="241.116"/>
She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag 
<Sync time="244.85"/>
and was going to dive in among the leaves, 
<Sync time="246.975"/>
when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry—
<Sync time="249.819"/>
a large pigeon had flown into her face 
<Sync time="252.413"/>
and was beating her violently with its wings.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="255.042" endTime="255.694">
<Sync time="255.042"/>
i015_th.jpg
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="255.694" endTime="258.616">
<Sync time="255.694"/>
"Serpent!" cried the Pigeon.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="258.616" endTime="262.913">
<Sync time="258.616"/>
"I'm not a serpent!" said Alice indignantly. 
<Sync time="261.101"/>
"Let me alone!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="262.913" endTime="271.209">
<Sync time="262.913"/>
"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges," 
<Sync time="266.553"/>
the Pigeon went on, 
<Sync time="267.553"/>
"but those serpents! 
<Sync time="268.803"/>
There's no pleasing them!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="271.209" endTime="273.443">
<Sync time="271.209"/>
Alice was more and more puzzled.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="273.443" endTime="292.444">
<Sync time="273.443"/>
"As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs," said the Pigeon, 
<Sync time="276.334"/>
"but I must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! 
<Sync time="279.474"/>
And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood," 
<Sync time="281.85"/>
continued the Pigeon, 
<Sync time="283.007"/>
raising its voice to a shriek, 
<Sync time="284.553"/>
"and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! 
<Sync time="289.976"/>
Ugh, 
<Sync time="290.601"/>
Serpent!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="292.444" endTime="304.352">
<Sync time="292.444"/>
"But I'm not a serpent, I tell you!" said Alice. 
<Sync time="295.053"/>
"I'm a—
<Sync time="295.944"/>
I'm a—
<Sync time="297.398"/>
I'm a little girl," 
<Sync time="298.632"/>
she added 
<Sync time="299.43"/>
rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="304.352" endTime="311.508">
<Sync time="304.352"/>
"You're looking for eggs, 
<Sync time="305.634"/>
I know that well enough," said the Pigeon; 
<Sync time="307.555"/>
"and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="311.508" endTime="321.007">
<Sync time="311.508"/>
"It matters a good deal to me," said Alice hastily; 
<Sync time="314.508"/>
"but I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens, 
<Sync time="316.711"/>
and if I was, I shouldn't want yours—
<Sync time="318.929"/>
I don't like them raw."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="321.007" endTime="353.211">
<Sync time="321.007"/>
"Well, be off, then!" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, 
<Sync time="324.022"/>
as it settled down again into its nest. 
<Sync time="326.96"/>
Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, 
<Sync time="329.897"/>
for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, 
<Sync time="332.835"/>
and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. 
<Sync time="336.522"/>
After awhile she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, 
<Sync time="340.835"/>
and she set to work very carefully, 
<Sync time="343.023"/>
nibbling first at one and then at the other, 
<Sync time="345.617"/>
and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, 
<Sync time="348.368"/>
until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="353.211" endTime="393.691">
<Sync time="353.211"/>
It was so long since she had been anything near the right size 
<Sync time="356.93"/>
that it felt quite strange at first. 
<Sync time="359.758"/>
"The next thing is to get into that beautiful garden—
<Sync time="362.461"/>
how is that to be done, I wonder?" 
<Sync time="364.93"/>
As she said this, 
<Sync time="366.212"/>
she came suddenly upon an open place, 
<Sync time="368.556"/>
with a little house in it about four feet high. 
<Sync time="371.525"/>
"Whoever lives there," thought Alice, 
<Sync time="373.634"/>
"it'll never do to come upon them this size; 
<Sync time="376.244"/>
why, I should frighten them out of their wits!" 
<Sync time="379.134"/>
She did not venture to go near the house 
<Sync time="381.634"/>
till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.
<Sync time="384.728"/>
