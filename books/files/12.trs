A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="27.392" endTime="41.56">
<Sync time="27.392"/>
They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—
<Sync time="31.345"/>
the birds with draggled feathers, 
<Sync time="33.548"/>
the animals with their fur clinging close to them, 
<Sync time="36.658"/>
and all 
<Sync time="37.658"/>
dripping wet, 
<Sync time="39.002"/>
cross 
<Sync time="39.862"/>
and uncomfortable.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="41.56" endTime="42.736">
<Sync time="41.56"/>
i008_th.jpg
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="42.736" endTime="57.377">
<Sync time="42.736"/>
The first question, of course, was how to get dry again. 
<Sync time="46.016"/>
They had a consultation about this 
<Sync time="48.032"/>
and after a few minutes, 
<Sync time="49.455"/>
it seemed quite natural to Alice 
<Sync time="51.69"/>
to find herself talking familiarly with them, 
<Sync time="54.377"/>
as if she had known them all her life.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="57.377" endTime="72.361">
<Sync time="57.377"/>
At last the Mouse, 
<Sync time="59.064"/>
who seemed to be a person of some authority among them, called out, 
<Sync time="62.486"/>
"Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! 
<Sync time="65.017"/>
I'll soon make you dry enough!" 
<Sync time="67.72"/>
They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse 
<Sync time="70.939"/>
in the middle.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="72.361" endTime="95.314">
<Sync time="72.361"/>
"Ahem!" 
<Sync time="73.688"/>
said the Mouse 
<Sync time="74.656"/>
with an important air. 
<Sync time="76.314"/>
"Are you all ready? 
<Sync time="77.97"/>
This is the driest thing I know. 
<Sync time="80.017"/>
Silence all 'round, if you please! 
<Sync time="82.048"/>
'William the Conqueror, 
<Sync time="83.454"/>
whose cause was favored by the pope, 
<Sync time="85.345"/>
was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, 
<Sync time="88.017"/>
and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. 
<Sync time="91.752"/>
Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of Mercia and Northumbria'—"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="95.314" endTime="98.189">
<Sync time="95.314"/>
"Ugh!" said the Lory, with a shiver.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="98.189" endTime="103.969">
<Sync time="98.189"/>
"—'And even Stigand, 
<Sync time="99.61"/>
the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, 
<Sync time="101.985"/>
found it advisable'—"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="103.969" endTime="106.407">
<Sync time="103.969"/>
"Found what?" said the Duck.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="106.407" endTime="113.375">
<Sync time="106.407"/>
"Found it," 
<Sync time="107.954"/>
the Mouse replied rather crossly; 
<Sync time="109.907"/>
"of course, you know what 'it' means."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="113.375" endTime="125.139">
<Sync time="113.375"/>
"I know what 'it' means 
<Sync time="114.813"/>
well enough, when I find a thing," 
<Sync time="116.796"/>
said the Duck; 
<Sync time="117.889"/>
"it's generally a frog or a worm. 
<Sync time="120.451"/>
The question is, what did the archbishop find?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="125.139" endTime="140.422">
<Sync time="125.139"/>
The Mouse 
<Sync time="126.03"/>
did not notice this question, 
<Sync time="127.843"/>
but hurriedly went on, 
<Sync time="129.64"/>
"'—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown.'—
<Sync time="134.953"/>
How are you getting on now, my dear?" 
<Sync time="136.859"/>
it continued, 
<Sync time="137.937"/>
turning to Alice as it spoke.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="140.422" endTime="147.312">
<Sync time="140.422"/>
"As wet as ever," said Alice in a melancholy tone; 
<Sync time="144.031"/>
"it doesn't seem to dry me at all."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="147.312" endTime="157.813">
<Sync time="147.312"/>
"In that case," 
<Sync time="148.578"/>
said the Dodo solemnly, 
<Sync time="150.047"/>
rising to its feet, 
<Sync time="151.625"/>
"I move that the meeting adjourn, 
<Sync time="153.782"/>
for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="157.813" endTime="165.83">
<Sync time="157.813"/>
"Speak English!" said the Eaglet. 
<Sync time="159.752"/>
"I don't know the meaning of half those long words, 
<Sync time="162.205"/>
and, what's more, 
<Sync time="163.048"/>
I don't believe you do either!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="165.83" endTime="174.799">
<Sync time="165.83"/>
"What I was going to say," 
<Sync time="167.737"/>
said the Dodo 
<Sync time="168.752"/>
in an offended tone, 
<Sync time="170.221"/>
"is that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="174.799" endTime="178.35">
<Sync time="174.799"/>
"What is a Caucus-race?" 
<Sync time="177.159"/>
said Alice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="178.35" endTime="178.893">
<Sync time="178.35"/>
i009_th.jpg
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="178.893" endTime="212.222">
<Sync time="178.893"/>
"Why," said the Dodo, 
<Sync time="180.392"/>
"the best way to explain it is to do it." 
<Sync time="183.299"/>
First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, 
<Sync time="186.47"/>
and then all the party were placed along the course, 
<Sync time="189.267"/>
here and there. 
<Sync time="190.267"/>
There was no "One, two, three and away!" 
<Sync time="192.454"/>
but they began running when they liked 
<Sync time="194.408"/>
and left off when they liked, 
<Sync time="196.158"/>
so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. 
<Sync time="200.064"/>
However, when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again, 
<Sync time="203.784"/>
the Dodo suddenly called out, 
<Sync time="205.581"/>
"The race is over!" 
<Sync time="206.909"/>
and they all crowded 'round it, 
<Sync time="208.769"/>
panting and asking, 
<Sync time="210.081"/>
"But who has won?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="212.222" endTime="221.957">
<Sync time="212.222"/>
This question 
<Sync time="213.457"/>
the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought. 
<Sync time="216.785"/>
At last it said, 
<Sync time="218.098"/>
"Everybody has won, 
<Sync time="219.332"/>
and all must have prizes."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="221.957" endTime="226.27">
<Sync time="221.957"/>
"But who is to give the prizes?" 
<Sync time="223.708"/>
quite a chorus of voices asked.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="226.27" endTime="237.489">
<Sync time="226.27"/>
"Why, she, of course," said the Dodo, 
<Sync time="228.645"/>
pointing to Alice with one finger; 
<Sync time="230.817"/>
and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, in a confused way, 
<Sync time="235.004"/>
"Prizes! Prizes!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="237.489" endTime="252.16">
<Sync time="237.489"/>
Alice had no idea what to do, 
<Sync time="239.472"/>
and in despair she put her hand into her pocket 
<Sync time="242.175"/>
and pulled out a box of comfits 
<Sync time="244.285"/>
(luckily the salt-water had not got into it) 
<Sync time="246.628"/>
and handed them 'round as prizes. 
<Sync time="248.644"/>
There was exactly one a-piece, 
<Sync time="250.66"/>
all 'round.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="252.16" endTime="270.817">
<Sync time="252.16"/>
The next thing was to eat the comfits; 
<Sync time="254.286"/>
this caused some noise and confusion, 
<Sync time="256.536"/>
as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, 
<Sync time="259.52"/>
and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. 
<Sync time="262.801"/>
However, 
<Sync time="263.754"/>
it was over at last 
<Sync time="265.332"/>
and they sat down again in a ring 
<Sync time="267.473"/>
and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="270.817" endTime="283.112">
<Sync time="270.817"/>
"You promised to tell me your history, you know," said Alice, 
<Sync time="274.082"/>
"and why it is you hate—
<Sync time="276.003"/>
C and D," 
<Sync time="277.722"/>
she added in a whisper, 
<Sync time="279.44"/>
half afraid that it would be offended again.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="283.112" endTime="289.626">
<Sync time="283.112"/>
"Mine is a long and a sad tale!" said the Mouse, 
<Sync time="286.689"/>
turning to Alice and sighing.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="289.626" endTime="305.392">
<Sync time="289.626"/>
"It is a long tail, certainly," said Alice, 
<Sync time="292.235"/>
looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail, 
<Sync time="294.954"/>
"but why do you call it sad?" 
<Sync time="297.485"/>
And she kept on puzzling about it 
<Sync time="299.423"/>
while the Mouse was speaking, 
<Sync time="301.001"/>
so that her idea of the tale was something like this:—
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="305.392" endTime="330.688">
<Sync time="305.392"/>
"Fury said to
a mouse, That
he met in the
house, 
<Sync time="308.485"/>
'Let
us both go
to law: 
<Sync time="310.328"/>
I
will prosecute
you.—

<Sync time="312.11"/>
Come, I'll
take no denial:

<Sync time="313.906"/>
We must have
the trial;
For really
this morning
I've
nothing
to do.'

<Sync time="317.687"/>
Said the
mouse to
the cur,

<Sync time="319.344"/>
'Such a
trial, dear
sir, With
no jury
or judge,
would
be wasting
our
breath.'

<Sync time="323.797"/>
'I'll be
judge,
I'll be
jury,'
said
cunning
old
Fury;

<Sync time="326.985"/>
'I'll
try
the
whole
cause,
and
condemn
you to
death.'"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="330.688" endTime="335.405">
<Sync time="330.688"/>
"You are not attending!" said the Mouse to Alice, severely. 
<Sync time="333.484"/>
"What are you thinking of?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="335.405" endTime="341.108">
<Sync time="335.405"/>
"I beg your pardon," said Alice very humbly, 
<Sync time="337.796"/>
"you had got to the fifth bend, I think?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="341.108" endTime="346.186">
<Sync time="341.108"/>
"You insult me by talking such nonsense!" said the Mouse, 
<Sync time="344.061"/>
getting up and walking away.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="346.186" endTime="358.733">
<Sync time="346.186"/>
"Please come back and finish your story!" 
<Sync time="348.515"/>
Alice called after it. 
<Sync time="350.062"/>
And the others all joined in chorus, 
<Sync time="352.109"/>
"Yes, 
<Sync time="352.64"/>
please do!" 
<Sync time="353.937"/>
But the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="358.733" endTime="382.032">
<Sync time="358.733"/>
"I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!" said Alice. 
<Sync time="362.342"/>
This caused a remarkable sensation among the party. 
<Sync time="365.701"/>
Some of the birds hurried off at once, 
<Sync time="367.858"/>
and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children, 
<Sync time="371.296"/>
"Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!" 
<Sync time="374.765"/>
On various pretexts they all moved off 
<Sync time="377.906"/>
and Alice was soon left alone.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="382.032" endTime="402.483">
<Sync time="382.032"/>
"I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah! 
<Sync time="384.281"/>
Nobody seems to like her down here 
<Sync time="386.406"/>
and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world!" 
<Sync time="389.531"/>
Poor Alice began to cry again, 
<Sync time="391.89"/>
for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. 
<Sync time="395.125"/>
In a little while, however, 
<Sync time="396.781"/>
she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance 
<Sync time="400.469"/>
and she looked up eagerly.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="402.483" endTime="411.716">
