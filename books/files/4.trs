EFFECT OF THOUGHT ON CIRCUMSTANCES
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="24.42" endTime="47.18">
<Sync time="24.42"/>
MAN'S mind may be likened to a garden, 
<Sync time="27.417"/>
which may be intelligently cultivated 
<Sync time="29.856"/>
or allowed to run wild; 
<Sync time="31.711"/>
but whether cultivated or neglected, 
<Sync time="34.49"/>
it must, 
<Sync time="35.26"/>
and will, 
<Sync time="36.051"/>
bring forth. 
<Sync time="37.526"/>
If no useful seeds are put into it, 
<Sync time="40.266"/>
then an abundance of useless weed-seeds will fall therein, 
<Sync time="43.691"/>
and will continue to produce their kind.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="47.18" endTime="89.201">
<Sync time="47.18"/>
Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, 
<Sync time="49.665"/>
keeping it free from weeds, and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, 
<Sync time="54.509"/>
so may a man tend the garden of his mind, 
<Sync time="57.252"/>
weeding out all the wrong, 
<Sync time="58.915"/>
useless, 
<Sync time="59.622"/>
and impure thoughts, 
<Sync time="60.979"/>
and cultivating toward perfection the flowers and fruits of right, 
<Sync time="64.863"/>
useful, and pure thoughts. 
<Sync time="67.264"/>
By pursuing this process, 
<Sync time="69.094"/>
a man sooner or later discovers that he is the master-gardener of his soul, 
<Sync time="73.493"/>
the director of his life. 
<Sync time="75.826"/>
He also reveals, within himself, 
<Sync time="77.718"/>
the laws of thought, 
<Sync time="78.794"/>
and understands, with ever-increasing accuracy, 
<Sync time="81.715"/>
how the thought-forces 
<Sync time="83.132"/>
and mind elements operate 
<Sync time="84.722"/>
in the shaping of his character, 
<Sync time="86.313"/>
circumstances, 
<Sync time="87.264"/>
and destiny.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="89.201" endTime="122.13">
<Sync time="89.201"/>
Thought and character are one, 
<Sync time="91.079"/>
and as character can only manifest and discover itself through environment 
<Sync time="95.257"/>
and circumstance, 
<Sync time="97.102"/>
the outer conditions of a person's life 
<Sync time="99.864"/>
will always be found to be harmoniously related to his inner state. 
<Sync time="104.679"/>
This does not mean that a man's circumstances at any given time 
<Sync time="108.381"/>
are an indication of his entire character, 
<Sync time="111.221"/>
but that those circumstances are so intimately connected with some vital thought-element within himself that, 
<Sync time="117.328"/>
for the time being, 
<Sync time="118.891"/>
they are indispensable to his development.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="122.13" endTime="143.362">
<Sync time="122.13"/>
Every man is where he is by the law of his being; 
<Sync time="125.59"/>
the thoughts which he has built into his character have brought him there, 
<Sync time="129.339"/>
and in the arrangement of his life there is no element of chance, 
<Sync time="133.116"/>
but all is the result of a law which cannot err. 
<Sync time="136.689"/>
This is just as true of those who feel "out of harmony" with their surroundings 
<Sync time="140.656"/>
as of those who are contented with them.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="143.362" endTime="158.764">
<Sync time="143.362"/>
As a progressive and evolving being, 
<Sync time="145.791"/>
man is where he is 
<Sync time="147.276"/>
that he may learn that he may grow; 
<Sync time="149.413"/>
and as he learns the spiritual lesson which any circumstance contains for him, 
<Sync time="154.366"/>
it passes away 
<Sync time="155.683"/>
and gives place to other circumstances.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="158.764" endTime="177.441">
<Sync time="158.764"/>
Man is buffeted by circumstances so long as he believes himself to be the creature of outside conditions, 
<Sync time="165.331"/>
but when he realizes that he is a creative power, 
<Sync time="168.361"/>
and that he may command the hidden soil and seeds of his being out of which circumstances grow, 
<Sync time="173.748"/>
he then becomes the rightful master of himself.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="177.441" endTime="205.936">
<Sync time="177.441"/>
That circumstances grow out of thought 
<Sync time="179.715"/>
every man knows who has for any length of time practised self-control and self-purification, 
<Sync time="185.61"/>
for he will have noticed that the alteration in his circumstances 
<Sync time="189.266"/>
has been in exact ratio 
<Sync time="190.812"/>
with his altered mental condition. 
<Sync time="193.437"/>
So true is this that when a man earnestly applies himself to remedy the defects in his character, 
<Sync time="198.994"/>
and makes swift and marked progress, 
<Sync time="201.373"/>
he passes rapidly through a succession of vicissitudes.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="205.936" endTime="225.907">
<Sync time="205.936"/>
The soul attracts that which it secretly harbours; 
<Sync time="209.612"/>
that which it loves, 
<Sync time="211.117"/>
and also that which it fears; 
<Sync time="213.228"/>
it reaches the height of its cherished aspirations; 
<Sync time="217.018"/>
it falls to the level of its unchastened desires,—
<Sync time="220.847"/>
and circumstances are the means by which the soul receives its own.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="225.907" endTime="243.725">
<Sync time="225.907"/>
Every thought-seed sown 
<Sync time="227.658"/>
or allowed to fall into the mind, 
<Sync time="229.617"/>
and to take root there, 
<Sync time="231.246"/>
produces its own, 
<Sync time="232.742"/>
blossoming sooner or later into act, 
<Sync time="235.55"/>
and bearing its own fruitage of opportunity 
<Sync time="237.961"/>
and circumstance. 
<Sync time="239.537"/>
Good thoughts bear good fruit, 
<Sync time="241.52"/>
bad thoughts bad fruit.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="243.725" endTime="260.587">
<Sync time="243.725"/>
The outer world of circumstance 
<Sync time="245.591"/>
shapes itself to the inner world of thought, 
<Sync time="248.237"/>
and both pleasant and unpleasant external conditions are factors, 
<Sync time="252.088"/>
which make for the ultimate good of the individual. 
<Sync time="255.268"/>
As the reaper of his own harvest, 
<Sync time="257.482"/>
man learns both by suffering and bliss.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="260.587" endTime="261.434">
<Sync time="260.587"/>
Following the inmost desires, aspirations, thoughts, by which he allows himself to be dominated, (pursuing the will-o'-the-wisps of impure imaginings or steadfastly walking the highway of strong and high endeavour), a man at last arrives at their fruition and fulfilment in the outer conditions of his life. The laws of growth and adjustment everywhere obtains.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="261.434" endTime="330.173">
<Sync time="261.434"/>
A man does not come to the almshouse 
<Sync time="263.697"/>
or the jail by the tyranny of fate 
<Sync time="265.836"/>
or circumstance, 
<Sync time="267.2"/>
but by the pathway of grovelling thoughts 
<Sync time="269.623"/>
and base desires. 
<Sync time="271.621"/>
Nor does 
<Sync time="272.6"/>
a pure-minded man fall suddenly into crime 
<Sync time="275.351"/>
by stress of any mere external force; 
<Sync time="278.286"/>
the criminal thought had long been secretly fostered in the heart, 
<Sync time="282.13"/>
and the hour of opportunity revealed its gathered power. 
<Sync time="286.833"/>
Circumstance does not make the man; 
<Sync time="288.914"/>
it reveals him to himself 
<Sync time="291.445"/>
No such conditions can exist 
<Sync time="293.453"/>
as descending into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations, 
<Sync time="298.63"/>
or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness 
<Sync time="301.335"/>
without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations; 
<Sync time="306.284"/>
and man, therefore, 
<Sync time="307.56"/>
as the lord and master of thought, 
<Sync time="309.807"/>
is the maker of himself 
<Sync time="311.534"/>
the shaper and author of environment. 
<Sync time="314.355"/>
Even at birth the soul comes to its own 
<Sync time="316.95"/>
and through every step of its earthly pilgrimage 
<Sync time="319.457"/>
it attracts those combinations of conditions which reveal itself, 
<Sync time="323.135"/>
which are the reflections of its own purity 
<Sync time="325.531"/>
and, impurity, 
<Sync time="326.585"/>
its strength 
<Sync time="327.545"/>
and weakness.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="330.173" endTime="377.297">
<Sync time="330.173"/>
Men do not attract that which they want, 
<Sync time="332.796"/>
but that which they are. 
<Sync time="335.175"/>
Their whims, 
<Sync time="336.128"/>
fancies, 
<Sync time="336.828"/>
and ambitions are thwarted at every step, 
<Sync time="339.347"/>
but their inmost thoughts and desires 
<Sync time="341.626"/>
are fed with their own food, 
<Sync time="343.46"/>
be it foul or clean. 
<Sync time="345.244"/>
The "divinity that shapes our ends" 
<Sync time="347.724"/>
is in ourselves; 
<Sync time="349.984"/>
it is our very self. 
<Sync time="352.323"/>
Only himself manacles man: 
<Sync time="355.202"/>
thought and action are the gaolers of Fate—
<Sync time="357.896"/>
they imprison, 
<Sync time="358.989"/>
being base; 
<Sync time="360.444"/>
they are also the angels of Freedom—
<Sync time="362.579"/>
they liberate, 
<Sync time="363.528"/>
being noble. 
<Sync time="365.162"/>
Not what he wishes and prays for does a man get, 
<Sync time="368.036"/>
but what he justly earns. 
<Sync time="369.967"/>
His wishes and prayers 
<Sync time="371.497"/>
are only gratified and answered 
<Sync time="373.287"/>
when they harmonize 
<Sync time="374.509"/>
with his thoughts 
<Sync time="375.354"/>
and actions.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="377.297" endTime="407.388">
<Sync time="377.297"/>
In the light of this truth, 
<Sync time="379.558"/>
what, then, 
<Sync time="380.476"/>
is the meaning of 
<Sync time="381.457"/>
"fighting against circumstances?" 
<Sync time="383.92"/>
It means that a man is continually revolting against an effect without, 
<Sync time="388.659"/>
while all the time 
<Sync time="389.928"/>
he is nourishing and preserving its cause in his heart. 
<Sync time="393.596"/>
That cause may take the form of a conscious vice 
<Sync time="396.875"/>
or an unconscious weakness; 
<Sync time="399.031"/>
but whatever it is, 
<Sync time="400.916"/>
it stubbornly retards the efforts of its possessor, 
<Sync time="404.395"/>
and thus calls aloud for remedy.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="407.388" endTime="442.714">
<Sync time="407.388"/>
Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, 
<Sync time="410.018"/>
but are unwilling to improve themselves; 
<Sync time="413.315"/>
they therefore remain bound. 
<Sync time="415.925"/>
The man who does not shrink from self-crucifixion 
<Sync time="419.096"/>
can never fail to accomplish 
<Sync time="420.91"/>
the object upon which his heart is set. 
<Sync time="424.199"/>
This is as true of earthly 
<Sync time="426.064"/>
as of heavenly things. 
<Sync time="427.952"/>
Even the man whose sole object is to acquire wealth 
<Sync time="431.1"/>
must be prepared to make great personal sacrifices 
<Sync time="434.227"/>
before he can accomplish his object; 
<Sync time="437.008"/>
and how much more so 
<Sync time="438.67"/>
he who would realize a strong and well-poised life?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="442.714" endTime="483.193">
<Sync time="442.714"/>
Here is a man who is wretchedly poor. 
<Sync time="445.23"/>
He is extremely anxious 
<Sync time="446.898"/>
that his surroundings and home comforts should be improved, 
<Sync time="450.219"/>
yet all the time he shirks his work, 
<Sync time="452.763"/>
and considers he is justified in trying to deceive his employer on the ground 
<Sync time="457.086"/>
of the insufficiency of his wages. 
<Sync time="460.352"/>
Such a man does not understand the simplest rudiments of those principles which are the basis of true prosperity, 
<Sync time="468.167"/>
and is not only 
<Sync time="469.743"/>
totally unfitted to rise out of his wretchedness, 
<Sync time="472.792"/>
but is actually attracting to himself 
<Sync time="475.227"/>
a still deeper wretchedness by dwelling in, 
<Sync time="477.757"/>
and acting out, 
<Sync time="478.887"/>
indolent, 
<Sync time="479.775"/>
deceptive, 
<Sync time="480.714"/>
and unmanly thoughts.

Here is a rich man who is the victim of a painful 
<Sync time="486.168"/>
and persistent disease 
<Sync time="487.592"/>
as the result of gluttony. 
<Sync time="489.586"/>
He is willing to give large sums of money to get rid of it, 
<Sync time="492.906"/>
but he will not sacrifice his gluttonous desires. 
<Sync time="496.61"/>
He wants to gratify his taste for rich and unnatural viands 
<Sync time="500.263"/>
and have his health as well. 
<Sync time="502.295"/>
Such a man is totally unfit to have health, 
<Sync time="505.111"/>
because he has not yet learned the first principles 
<Sync time="507.939"/>
of a healthy life.

Here is an employer of labour

who adopts crooked measures to avoid paying the regulation wage,

and, 
<Sync time="517.614"/>
in the hope of making larger profits, 
<Sync time="520.066"/>
reduces the wages of his workpeople. 
<Sync time="523.194"/>
Such a man is altogether unfitted for prosperity, 
<Sync time="526.916"/>
and when he finds himself bankrupt, 
<Sync time="528.857"/>
both as regards reputation and riches, 
<Sync time="531.972"/>
he blames circumstances, 
<Sync time="533.904"/>
not knowing that he is the sole author of his condition.

I have introduced these three cases 
<Sync time="540.642"/>
merely as illustrative of the truth that man is the causer 
<Sync time="544.391"/>
(though nearly always is unconsciously) 
<Sync time="546.422"/>
of his circumstances, 
<Sync time="548.346"/>
and that, whilst aiming at a good end, 
<Sync time="550.13"/>
he is continually frustrating its accomplishment 
<Sync time="552.897"/>
by encouraging thoughts and desires which cannot possibly harmonize with that end. 
<Sync time="558.353"/>
Such cases could be multiplied and varied almost indefinitely, 
<Sync time="562.138"/>
but this is not necessary, 
<Sync time="563.833"/>
as the reader can, 
<Sync time="564.915"/>
if he so resolves, 
<Sync time="566.314"/>
trace the action of the laws of thought in his own mind and life, 
<Sync time="570.173"/>
and until this is done, 
<Sync time="571.705"/>
mere external facts cannot serve as a ground of reasoning.

<Sync time="575.847"/>
Circumstances, however, 
<Sync time="577.483"/>
are so complicated, 
<Sync time="579.052"/>
thought is so deeply rooted, 
<Sync time="580.805"/>
and the conditions of happiness vary so, vastly with individuals, 
<Sync time="585.191"/>
that a man's entire soul-condition 
<Sync time="587.614"/>
(although it may be known to himself) 
<Sync time="589.707"/>
cannot be judged by another from the external aspect of his life alone. 
<Sync time="594.68"/>
A man may be honest in certain directions, 
<Sync time="597.228"/>
yet suffer privations; a 
<Sync time="599.026"/>
man may be dishonest in certain directions, 
<Sync time="601.779"/>
yet acquire wealth; 
<Sync time="603.833"/>
but the conclusion usually formed that the one man fails 
<Sync time="607.337"/>
because of his particular honesty, 
<Sync time="609.471"/>
and that the other prospers because of his particular dishonesty, 
<Sync time="613.42"/>
is the result of a superficial judgment, 
<Sync time="616.053"/>
which assumes that the dishonest man 
<Sync time="618.291"/>
is almost totally corrupt, 
<Sync time="619.823"/>
and the honest man almost entirely virtuous. 
<Sync time="623.082"/>
In the light of a deeper knowledge and wider experience 
<Sync time="626.052"/>
such judgment is found to be erroneous. 
<Sync time="629.146"/>
The dishonest man 
<Sync time="630.515"/>
may have some admirable virtues, 
<Sync time="632.601"/>
which the other does, not possess; 
<Sync time="634.481"/>
and the honest man 
<Sync time="635.784"/>
obnoxious vices which are absent in the other. 
<Sync time="638.805"/>
The honest man reaps the good results of his honest thoughts and acts; 
<Sync time="642.713"/>
he also brings upon himself the sufferings, 
<Sync time="645.296"/>
which his vices produce. 
<Sync time="647.932"/>
The dishonest man 
<Sync time="649.218"/>
likewise garners his own suffering and happiness.

It is pleasing to human vanity 
<Sync time="655.179"/>
to believe that one suffers because of one's virtue;

but not until a man has extirpated every sickly, 
<Sync time="661.573"/>
bitter, 
<Sync time="662.173"/>
and impure thought from his mind, 
<Sync time="664.413"/>
and washed every sinful stain from his soul,

can he be in a position to know and declare that his sufferings are the result of his good,

and not of his bad qualities; 
<Sync time="675.013"/>
and on the way to, yet long before he has reached, that supreme perfection,

working in his mind and life,

the Great Law which is absolutely just,

evil for good.

Possessed of such knowledge,

that his life is,

justly ordered,

good and bad,

Suffering is always the effect of wrong thought in some direction.

It is an indication that the individual is out of harmony with himself,

The sole and supreme use of suffering is to purify,

Suffering ceases for him who is pure.
