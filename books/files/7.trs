THE THOUGHT-FACTOR IN ACHIEVEMENT
</Turn>
<Turn startTime="26.254" endTime="72.467" speaker="spk1">
<Sync time="26.254"/>
ALL that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve 
<Sync time="29.552"/>
is the direct result of his own thoughts. 
<Sync time="32.874"/>
In a justly ordered universe, 
<Sync time="34.907"/>
where loss of equipoise would mean total destruction, 
<Sync time="38.108"/>
individual responsibility 
<Sync time="40.192"/>
must be absolute. 
<Sync time="42.375"/>
A man's weakness and strength, 
<Sync time="44.225"/>
purity and impurity, 
<Sync time="46.089"/>
are his own, 
<Sync time="47.435"/>
and not another man's; 
<Sync time="49.466"/>
they are brought about by himself, 
<Sync time="51.455"/>
and not by another; 
<Sync time="53.071"/>
and they can only be altered by himself, 
<Sync time="55.863"/>
never by another. 
<Sync time="57.876"/>
His condition is also his own, 
<Sync time="59.758"/>
and not another man's. 
<Sync time="61.612"/>
His suffering and his happiness are evolved from within. 
<Sync time="65.186"/>
As he thinks, 
<Sync time="66.544"/>
so he is; 
<Sync time="68.016"/>
as he continues to think, 
<Sync time="69.95"/>
so he remains.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="72.467" endTime="91.754">
<Sync time="72.467"/>
A strong man cannot help a weaker 
<Sync time="74.535"/>
unless that weaker is willing to be helped, 
<Sync time="77.539"/>
and even then the weak man 
<Sync time="79.278"/>
must become strong of himself; 
<Sync time="81.908"/>
he must, by his own efforts, 
<Sync time="84.199"/>
develop the strength which he admires in another. 
<Sync time="87.785"/>
None but himself can alter his condition.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="91.754" endTime="113.626">
<Sync time="91.754"/>
It has been usual for men to think and to say, 
<Sync time="94.834"/>
"Many men are slaves because one is an oppressor; 
<Sync time="98.049"/>
let us hate the oppressor." 
<Sync time="100.621"/>
Now, however, 
<Sync time="101.868"/>
there is amongst an increasing few 
<Sync time="103.886"/>
a tendency to reverse this judgment, 
<Sync time="106.481"/>
and to say, 
<Sync time="107.838"/>
"One man is an oppressor because many are slaves; 
<Sync time="110.943"/>
let us despise the slaves."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="113.626" endTime="144.849">
<Sync time="113.626"/>
The truth is that oppressor and slave are co-operators in ignorance, 
<Sync time="118.181"/>
and, 
<Sync time="118.952"/>
while seeming to afflict each other, 
<Sync time="121.107"/>
are in reality afflicting themselves. 
<Sync time="124.33"/>
A perfect Knowledge perceives the action of law in the weakness of the oppressed 
<Sync time="128.945"/>
and the misapplied power of the oppressor; 
<Sync time="132.667"/>
a perfect Love, 
<Sync time="134.19"/>
seeing the suffering, which both states entail, 
<Sync time="137.377"/>
condemns neither; 
<Sync time="139.25"/>
a perfect Compassion embraces both oppressor and oppressed.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="144.849" endTime="154.789">
<Sync time="144.849"/>
He who has conquered weakness, 
<Sync time="147.058"/>
and has put away all selfish thoughts, 
<Sync time="149.426"/>
belongs neither to oppressor nor oppressed. 
<Sync time="152.529"/>
He is free.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="154.789" endTime="167.165">
<Sync time="154.789"/>
A man can only rise, conquer, 
<Sync time="156.942"/>
and achieve 
<Sync time="158.151"/>
by lifting up his thoughts. 
<Sync time="160.604"/>
He can only remain weak, 
<Sync time="162.185"/>
and abject, 
<Sync time="163.101"/>
and miserable 
<Sync time="164.226"/>
by refusing to lift up his thoughts.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="167.165" endTime="216.645">
<Sync time="167.165"/>
Before a man can achieve anything, 
<Sync time="169.509"/>
even in worldly things, 
<Sync time="171.275"/>
he must lift his thoughts above slavish animal indulgence. 
<Sync time="175.001"/>
He may not, 
<Sync time="176.084"/>
in order to succeed, 
<Sync time="177.74"/>
give up all animality and selfishness, 
<Sync time="180.422"/>
by any means; 
<Sync time="181.862"/>
but a portion of it must, at least, be sacrificed. 
<Sync time="185.535"/>
A man whose first thought is bestial indulgence 
<Sync time="188.307"/>
could neither think clearly 
<Sync time="189.649"/>
nor plan methodically; 
<Sync time="191.677"/>
he could not find and develop his latent resources, 
<Sync time="195.158"/>
and would fail in any undertaking. 
<Sync time="199.054"/>
Not having commenced to manfully control his thoughts, 
<Sync time="202.281"/>
he is not in a position to control affairs 
<Sync time="204.941"/>
and to adopt serious responsibilities. 
<Sync time="208.1"/>
He is not fit to act independently and stand alone. 
<Sync time="212.235"/>
But he is limited only by the thoughts, which he chooses.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="216.645" endTime="245.697">
<Sync time="216.645"/>
There can be no progress, 
<Sync time="218.234"/>
no achievement 
<Sync time="219.379"/>
without sacrifice, 
<Sync time="221.708"/>
and a man's worldly success will be in the measure that he sacrifices his confused animal thoughts, 
<Sync time="227.403"/>
and fixes his mind on the development of his plans, 
<Sync time="230.596"/>
and the strengthening 
<Sync time="231.905"/>
of his resolution and self-reliance. 
<Sync time="235.002"/>
And the higher he lifts his thoughts, 
<Sync time="236.97"/>
the more manly, 
<Sync time="238.069"/>
upright, 
<Sync time="238.724"/>
and righteous he becomes, 
<Sync time="240.674"/>
the greater will be his success, 
<Sync time="242.508"/>
the more blessed and enduring will be his achievements.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="245.697" endTime="272.403">
<Sync time="245.697"/>
The universe does not favour the greedy, 
<Sync time="247.931"/>
the dishonest, 
<Sync time="248.957"/>
the vicious, 
<Sync time="250.011"/>
although on the mere surface it may sometimes appear to do so; 
<Sync time="254.624"/>
it helps the honest, 
<Sync time="256.178"/>
the magnanimous, 
<Sync time="257.515"/>
the virtuous. 
<Sync time="259.09"/>
All the great Teachers of the ages have declared this in varying forms, 
<Sync time="263.941"/>
and to prove and know it 
<Sync time="265.735"/>
a man has but to persist 
<Sync time="267.77"/>
in making himself more and more virtuous 
<Sync time="270.242"/>
by lifting up his thoughts.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="272.403" endTime="298.05">
<Sync time="272.403"/>
Intellectual achievements are the result of thought 
<Sync time="275.205"/>
consecrated to the search for knowledge, 
<Sync time="278.064"/>
or for the beautiful 
<Sync time="279.397"/>
and true in life and nature. 
<Sync time="282.12"/>
Such achievements may be sometimes connected with vanity and ambition, 
<Sync time="286.805"/>
but they are not the outcome of those characteristics; 
<Sync time="290.402"/>
they are the natural outgrowth 
<Sync time="292.149"/>
of long and arduous effort, 
<Sync time="294.39"/>
and of pure 
<Sync time="295.395"/>
and unselfish thoughts.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="298.05" endTime="321.446">
<Sync time="298.05"/>
Spiritual achievements are the consummation 
<Sync time="300.51"/>
of holy aspirations. 
<Sync time="302.725"/>
He who lives constantly in the conception of noble and lofty thoughts, 
<Sync time="306.954"/>
who dwells upon all that is pure and unselfish, 
<Sync time="310.394"/>
will, 
<Sync time="311.036"/>
as surely as the sun reaches its zenith 
<Sync time="313.303"/>
and the moon its full, 
<Sync time="314.83"/>
become wise and noble in character,

Achievement,

of whatever kind,

is the crown of effort,

the diadem of thought.

By the aid of self-control,

resolution,

purity,

righteousness,

and well-directed thought

a man ascends;

indolence,

impurity,

corruption,

and confusion of thought

a man descends.

selfish,

Victories attained by right thought
