VISIONS AND IDEALS

<Sync time="24.591"/>
THE dreamers are the saviours of the world. 
<Sync time="27.558"/>
As the visible world is sustained by the invisible, 
<Sync time="30.794"/>
so men, 
<Sync time="31.922"/>
through all their trials and sins and sordid vocations, 
<Sync time="35.512"/>
are nourished by the beautiful visions of their solitary dreamers. 
<Sync time="40.114"/>
Humanity cannot forget its dreamers; 
<Sync time="43.259"/>
it cannot let their ideals fade and die; 
<Sync time="46.555"/>
it lives in them; 
<Sync time="47.937"/>
it knows them as they realities 
<Sync time="50.209"/>
which it shall one day see and know.

poet,

sage, 
<Sync time="59.061"/>
these are the makers of the after-world, 
<Sync time="61.098"/>
the architects of heaven. 
<Sync time="63.574"/>
The world is beautiful because they have lived; 
<Sync time="66.255"/>
without them, 
<Sync time="67.293"/>
labouring humanity 
<Sync time="69.11"/>
would perish.

He who cherishes a beautiful vision, 
<Sync time="73.841"/>
a lofty ideal in his heart, 
<Sync time="75.863"/>
will one day realize it. 
<Sync time="78.228"/>
Columbus cherished a vision of another world, 
<Sync time="80.981"/>
and he discovered it; 
<Sync time="82.751"/>
Copernicus fostered the vision of a multiplicity of worlds 
<Sync time="86.379"/>
and a wider universe, 
<Sync time="88.025"/>
and he revealed it; 
<Sync time="90.218"/>
Buddha beheld the vision of a spiritual world 
<Sync time="92.98"/>
of stainless beauty and perfect peace, 
<Sync time="95.784"/>
and he entered into it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="98.527" endTime="124.429">
<Sync time="98.527"/>
Cherish your visions; 
<Sync time="100.419"/>
cherish your ideals; 
<Sync time="102.469"/>
cherish the music that stirs in your heart, 
<Sync time="105.464"/>
the beauty that forms in your mind, 
<Sync time="107.548"/>
the loveliness that drapes your purest thoughts, 
<Sync time="110.608"/>
for out of them will grow all delightful conditions, 
<Sync time="113.743"/>
all, heavenly environment; 
<Sync time="116.539"/>
of these, 
<Sync time="117.577"/>
if you but remain true to them, 
<Sync time="119.453"/>
your world will at last be built.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="124.429" endTime="147.024">
<Sync time="124.429"/>
To desire is to obtain; 
<Sync time="126.844"/>
to aspire is to, achieve. 
<Sync time="130.16"/>
Shall man's basest desires 
<Sync time="132.265"/>
receive the fullest measure of gratification, 
<Sync time="135.015"/>
and his purest aspirations starve for lack of sustenance? 
<Sync time="140.047"/>
Such is not the Law: 
<Sync time="141.85"/>
such a condition of things can never obtain: 
<Sync time="144.719"/>
"ask and receive."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="147.024" endTime="159.11">
<Sync time="147.024"/>
Dream lofty dreams, 
<Sync time="148.501"/>
and as you dream, 
<Sync time="149.725"/>
so shall you become. 
<Sync time="151.503"/>
Your Vision is the promise of what you shall one day be; 
<Sync time="154.758"/>
your Ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil.

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="159.11" endTime="176.162">

The greatest achievement was at first 
<Sync time="161.289"/>
and for a time a dream. 
<Sync time="163.367"/>
The oak sleeps in the acorn; 
<Sync time="165.861"/>
the bird waits in the egg; 
<Sync time="168.019"/>
and in the highest vision of the soul a waking angel stirs. 
<Sync time="172.645"/>
Dreams are the seedlings of realities.

<Sync time="176.162"/>
Your circumstances may be uncongenial, 
<Sync time="179.006"/>
but they shall not long remain so 
<Sync time="181.185"/>
if you but perceive an Ideal and strive to reach it. 
<Sync time="185.376"/>
You cannot travel within 
<Sync time="186.976"/>
and stand still without. 
<Sync time="189.748"/>
Here is a youth hard pressed by poverty and labour; 
<Sync time="193.315"/>
confined long hours in an unhealthy workshop; 
<Sync time="196.673"/>
unschooled, 
<Sync time="197.992"/>
and lacking all the arts of refinement. 
<Sync time="200.885"/>
But he dreams of better things; 
<Sync time="203.601"/>
he thinks of intelligence, 
<Sync time="205.243"/>
of refinement, 
<Sync time="206.332"/>
of grace and beauty. 
<Sync time="209.019"/>
He conceives of, 
<Sync time="210.659"/>
mentally builds up, 
<Sync time="212.367"/>
an ideal condition of life; 
<Sync time="215.261"/>
the vision of a wider liberty 
<Sync time="217.085"/>
and a larger scope takes possession of him; 
<Sync time="220.332"/>
unrest urges him to action, 
<Sync time="223.328"/>
and he utilizes all his spare time and means, 
<Sync time="226.494"/>
small though they are, 
<Sync time="227.968"/>
to the development of his latent powers and resources. 
<Sync time="232.638"/>
Very soon so altered has his mind become that the workshop can no longer hold him. 
<Sync time="237.775"/>
It has become so out of harmony with his mentality 
<Sync time="240.89"/>
that it falls out of his life as a garment is cast aside, 
<Sync time="244.942"/>
and, 
<Sync time="246.041"/>
with the growth of opportunities, which fit the scope of his expanding powers, 
<Sync time="250.38"/>
he passes out of it forever. 
<Sync time="253.358"/>
Years later we see this youth as a full-grown man. 
<Sync time="257.333"/>
We find him a master of certain forces of the mind, 
<Sync time="260.277"/>
which he wields with worldwide influence 
<Sync time="262.573"/>
and almost unequalled power. 
<Sync time="265.126"/>
In his hands he holds the cords of gigantic responsibilities; 
<Sync time="269.137"/>
he speaks, and lo, 
<Sync time="270.768"/>
lives are changed; 
<Sync time="272.454"/>
men and women hang upon his words and remould their characters, 
<Sync time="276.432"/>
and, 
<Sync time="277.257"/>
sunlike, 
<Sync time="278.53"/>
he becomes the fixed and luminous centre round which innumerable destinies revolve. 
<Sync time="284.516"/>
He has realized the Vision of his youth. 
<Sync time="286.937"/>
He has become one with his Ideal.
</Turn>
<Turn startTime="290.218" endTime="380.896">
<Sync time="290.218"/>
And you, too, 
<Sync time="291.291"/>
youthful reader, 
<Sync time="292.453"/>
will realize the Vision 
<Sync time="293.948"/>
(not the idle wish) 
<Sync time="295.295"/>
of your heart, 
<Sync time="296.399"/>
be it base or beautiful, 
<Sync time="298.743"/>
or a mixture of both, 
<Sync time="300.6"/>
for you will always gravitate toward that which you, secretly, most love. 
<Sync time="305.125"/>
Into your hands will be placed the exact results of your own thoughts; 
<Sync time="309.195"/>
you will receive that which you earn; 
<Sync time="311.323"/>
no more, no less. 
<Sync time="313.379"/>
Whatever your present environment may be, 
<Sync time="315.832"/>
you will fall, 
<Sync time="316.949"/>
remain, 
<Sync time="317.604"/>
or rise with your thoughts, 
<Sync time="319.84"/>
your Vision, 
<Sync time="320.834"/>
your Ideal. 
<Sync time="322.564"/>
You will become as small as your controlling desire; 
<Sync time="325.44"/>
as great as your dominant aspiration: 
<Sync time="328.763"/>
in the beautiful words of Stanton Kirkham Davis, 
<Sync time="332.043"/>
"You may be keeping accounts, 
<Sync time="333.760"/>
and presently you shall walk out of the door that for so long has seemed to you the barrier of your ideals, 
<Sync time="339.624"/>
and shall find yourself before an audienceâ€”
<Sync time="342.208"/>
the pen still behind your ear, 
<Sync time="344.368"/>
the ink stains on your fingers 
<Sync time="346.5"/>
and then and there shall pour out the torrent of your inspiration. 
<Sync time="350.971"/>
You may be driving sheep, 
<Sync time="352.745"/>
and you shall wander to the city-
<Sync time="355.088"/>
bucolic and open-mouthed; 
<Sync time="357.334"/>
shall wander under the intrepid guidance of the spirit 
<Sync time="360.673"/>
into the studio of the master, 
<Sync time="362.812"/>
and after a time he shall say, 
<Sync time="365.361"/>
'I have nothing more to teach you.' 
<Sync time="367.583"/>
And now you have become the master, 
<Sync time="369.815"/>
who did so recently dream of great things while driving sheep. 
<Sync time="374.471"/>
You shall lay down the saw 
<Sync time="376.036"/>
and the plane to take upon yourself 
<Sync time="378.034"/>
the regeneration of the world."

The thoughtless,

the ignorant,

and the indolent,

seeing only the apparent effects of things and not the things themselves,

talk of luck,

of fortune,

Seeing a man grow rich, they say,

Observing another become intellectual,

they remark,

"How chance aids him at every turn!"

of the faith

they have exercised,

that they might overcome the apparently insurmountable, and realize the Vision of their heart.

They do not know the darkness and the heartaches;

they only see the light and joy,

and call it

"good fortune,"

do not understand the process,
