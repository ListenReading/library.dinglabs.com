A MAD TEA-PARTY
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="24.406" endTime="34.625">
<Sync time="24.406"/>
There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, 
<Sync time="27.484"/>
and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it; 
<Sync time="30.359"/>
a Dormouse was sitting between them, 
<Sync time="32.36"/>
fast asleep.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="34.625" endTime="50.515">
<Sync time="34.625"/>
The table was a large one, 
<Sync time="36.156"/>
but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it. 
<Sync time="39.406"/>
"No room! No room!" they cried out when they saw Alice coming. 
<Sync time="43.171"/>
"There's plenty of room!" 
<Sync time="44.405"/>
said Alice indignantly, 
<Sync time="46.015"/>
and she sat down 
<Sync time="47.077"/>
in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="50.515" endTime="58.373">
<Sync time="50.515"/>
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this, but all he said was 
<Sync time="55.186"/>
"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="58.373" endTime="63.889">
<Sync time="58.373"/>
"I'm glad they've begun asking riddles—
<Sync time="60.624"/>
I believe I can guess that," 
<Sync time="62.108"/>
she added aloud.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="63.889" endTime="68.138">
<Sync time="63.889"/>
"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?" 
<Sync time="66.451"/>
said the March Hare.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="68.138" endTime="70.482">
<Sync time="68.138"/>
"Exactly so," said Alice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="70.482" endTime="73.464">
<Sync time="70.482"/>
"Then you should say what you mean," 
<Sync time="71.902"/>
the March Hare went on.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="73.464" endTime="82.634">
<Sync time="73.464"/>
"I do," 
<Sync time="74.479"/>
Alice hastily replied; 
<Sync time="76.088"/>
"at least—
<Sync time="77.697"/>
at least 
<Sync time="78.4"/>
I mean what I say—
<Sync time="79.962"/>
that's the same thing, you know."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="82.634" endTime="93.445">
<Sync time="82.634"/>
"You might just as well say," 
<Sync time="84.431"/>
added the Dormouse, 
<Sync time="85.586"/>
which seemed to be talking in its sleep, 
<Sync time="87.82"/>
"that 'I breathe when I sleep' 
<Sync time="89.664"/>
is the same thing as 'I sleep when I breathe!'"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="93.445" endTime="107.086">
<Sync time="93.445"/>
"It is the same thing with you," said the Hatter, 
<Sync time="95.836"/>
and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. 
<Sync time="98.711"/>
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently and said, 
<Sync time="101.18"/>
without opening its eyes, 
<Sync time="102.914"/>
"Of course, of course; 
<Sync time="104.492"/>
just what I was going to remark myself."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="107.086" endTime="108.086">
<Sync time="107.086"/>

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="108.086" endTime="112.914">
<Sync time="108.086"/>
"Have you guessed the riddle yet?" 
<Sync time="109.68"/>
the Hatter said, 
<Sync time="110.836"/>
turning to Alice again.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="112.914" endTime="116.695">
<Sync time="112.914"/>
"No, I give it up," Alice replied. 
<Sync time="114.929"/>
"What's the answer?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="116.695" endTime="119.273">
<Sync time="116.695"/>
"I haven't the slightest idea," said the Hatter.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="119.273" endTime="121.539">
<Sync time="119.273"/>
"Nor I," said the March Hare.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="121.539" endTime="130.726">
<Sync time="121.539"/>
Alice gave a weary sigh. 
<Sync time="123.929"/>
"I think you might do something better with the time," she said, 
<Sync time="126.929"/>
"than wasting it in asking riddles that have no answers."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="130.726" endTime="135.134">
<Sync time="130.726"/>
"Take some more tea," 
<Sync time="131.96"/>
the March Hare said to Alice, 
<Sync time="133.43"/>
very earnestly.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="135.134" endTime="140.869">
<Sync time="135.134"/>
"I've had nothing yet," 
<Sync time="136.525"/>
Alice replied in an offended tone, 
<Sync time="138.744"/>
"so I can't take more."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="140.869" endTime="146.759">
<Sync time="140.869"/>
"You mean you can't take less," 
<Sync time="142.306"/>
said the Hatter; 
<Sync time="143.337"/>
"it's very easy to take more than nothing."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="146.759" endTime="161.088">
<Sync time="146.759"/>
At this, 
<Sync time="147.618"/>
Alice got up and walked off. 
<Sync time="150.009"/>
The Dormouse fell asleep instantly 
<Sync time="152.196"/>
and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, 
<Sync time="155.024"/>
though she looked back once or twice; 
<Sync time="156.93"/>
the last time she saw them, 
<Sync time="158.368"/>
they were trying to put the Dormouse into the tea-pot.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="161.088" endTime="161.821">
<Sync time="161.088"/>

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="161.821" endTime="183.868">
<Sync time="161.821"/>
"At any rate, I'll never go there again!" 
<Sync time="163.696"/>
said Alice, as she picked her way through the wood. 
<Sync time="166.305"/>
"It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!" 
<Sync time="170.883"/>
Just as she said this, 
<Sync time="172.383"/>
she noticed that 
<Sync time="173.679"/>
one of the trees had a door leading right into it. 
<Sync time="177.461"/>
"That's very curious!" she thought. 
<Sync time="179.539"/>
"I think I may as well go in at once." 
<Sync time="181.993"/>
And in she went.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="183.868" endTime="218.802">
<Sync time="183.868"/>
Once more she found herself in the long hall 
<Sync time="186.774"/>
and close to the little glass table. 
<Sync time="189.821"/>
Taking the little golden key, 
<Sync time="191.634"/>
she unlocked the door that led into the garden. 
<Sync time="194.586"/>
Then she set to work 
<Sync time="195.711"/>
nibbling at the mushroom 
<Sync time="197.149"/>
(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) 
<Sync time="199.195"/>
till she was about a foot high; 
<Sync time="201.117"/>
then she walked down the little passage; 
<Sync time="203.461"/>
and then—
<Sync time="204.383"/>
she found herself at last 
<Sync time="206.274"/>
in the beautiful garden, 
<Sync time="207.696"/>
among the bright flower-beds 
<Sync time="209.508"/>
and the cool fountains.
<Sync time="211.232"/>
