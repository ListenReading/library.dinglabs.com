CHAPTER ONE

<Sync time="7.715"/>
THE BOY WHO LIVED
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="10.189" endTime="27.225">
<Sync time="10.189"/>
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, 
<Sync time="11.986"/>
of number four, Privet Drive, 
<Sync time="14.813"/>
were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, 
<Sync time="17.616"/>
thank you very much. 
<Sync time="19.261"/>
They were the last people 
<Sync time="20.915"/>
you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, 
<Sync time="24.491"/>
because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="27.225" endTime="58.864">
<Sync time="27.225"/>
Mr. Dursley 
<Sync time="28.455"/>
was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. 
<Sync time="32.152"/>
He was a big, beefy man 
<Sync time="34.218"/>
with hardly any neck, 
<Sync time="35.408"/>
although he did have a very large mustache. 
<Sync time="37.779"/>
Mrs. Dursley 
<Sync time="38.854"/>
was thin and blonde 
<Sync time="40.459"/>
and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, 
<Sync time="43.637"/>
which came in very useful 
<Sync time="45.11"/>
as she spent so much of her time 
<Sync time="47.18"/>
craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. 
<Sync time="51.92"/>
The Dursleys 
<Sync time="53.046"/>
had a small son called Dudley 
<Sync time="55.499"/>
and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="58.864" endTime="102.979">
<Sync time="58.864"/>
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, 
<Sync time="61.404"/>
but they also had a secret, 
<Sync time="63.399"/>
and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. 
<Sync time="66.16"/>
They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. 
<Sync time="69.781"/>
Mrs. Potter 
<Sync time="70.787"/>
was Mrs. Dursley's sister, 
<Sync time="72.476"/>
but they hadn't met for several years; 
<Sync time="74.56"/>
in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, 
<Sync time="77.476"/>
because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. 
<Sync time="84.323"/>
The Dursleys 
<Sync time="85.236"/>
shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. 
<Sync time="90.487"/>
The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, 
<Sync time="93.113"/>
but they had never even seen him. 
<Sync time="95.015"/>
This boy 
<Sync time="95.981"/>
was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; 
<Sync time="99.091"/>
they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="102.979" endTime="131.2">
<Sync time="102.979"/>
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. 
<Sync time="120.592"/>
Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, 
<Sync time="125.326"/>
and Mrs. Dursley 
<Sync time="126.38"/>
gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="131.2" endTime="135.897">
<Sync time="131.2"/>
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="135.897" endTime="157.733">
<Sync time="135.897"/>
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, 
<Sync time="138.664"/>
pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, 
<Sync time="140.636"/>
and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye 
<Sync time="143.066"/>
but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. 
<Sync time="148.829"/>
"Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. 
<Sync time="153.691"/>
He got into his car 
<Sync time="155.069"/>
and backed out of number four's drive.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="157.733" endTime="181.9">
<Sync time="157.733"/>
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar — 
<Sync time="161.926"/>
a cat 
<Sync time="163.09"/>
reading a map. 
<Sync time="165.937"/>
For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen — 
<Sync time="169.663"/>
then he jerked his head around to look again. 
<Sync time="172.874"/>
There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, 
<Sync time="175.839"/>
but there wasn't a map in sight. 
<Sync time="177.903"/>
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="181.9" endTime="194.03">
<Sync time="181.9"/>
Mr. Dursley blinked 
<Sync time="183.543"/>
and stared at the cat. 
<Sync time="185.167"/>
It stared back. 
<Sync time="187.711"/>
As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, 
<Sync time="191.142"/>
he watched the cat in his mirror.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="194.03" endTime="218.798">
<Sync time="194.03"/>
It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — 
<Sync time="199.382"/>
no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. 
<Sync time="203.272"/>
Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. 
<Sync time="207.781"/>
As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
<Sync time="213.697"/>
But on the edge of town, 
<Sync time="215.359"/>
drills were driven out of his mind by something else.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="218.798" endTime="247.031">
<Sync time="218.798"/>
As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, 
<Sync time="221.455"/>
he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. 
<Sync time="226.165"/>
People in cloaks. 
<Sync time="228.508"/>
Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes — 
<Sync time="232.021"/>
the getups you saw on young people! 
<Sync time="235.362"/>
He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. 
<Sync time="238.002"/>
He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel 
<Sync time="240.589"/>
and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. 
<Sync time="244.283"/>
They were whispering excitedly together.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="247.031" endTime="279.188">
<Sync time="247.031"/>
Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; 
<Sync time="251.89"/>
why, 
<Sync time="252.818"/>
that man had to be older than he was, 
<Sync time="254.941"/>
and wearing an emerald-green cloak! 
<Sync time="257.699"/>
The nerve of him! 
<Sync time="260.041"/>
But then 
<Sync time="261.202"/>
it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt — 
<Sync time="264.439"/>
these people were obviously collecting for something... 
<Sync time="267.363"/>
yes, 
<Sync time="268.261"/>
that would be it. 
<Sync time="269.992"/>
The traffic moved on 
<Sync time="271.867"/>
and a few minutes later, 
<Sync time="273.323"/>
Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, 
<Sync time="276.058"/>
his mind back on drills.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="279.188" endTime="322.395">
<Sync time="279.188"/>
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. 
<Sync time="285.015"/>
If he hadn't, 
<Sync time="286.634"/>
he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. 
<Sync time="290.189"/>
He didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, 
<Sync time="293.152"/>
though people down in the street did; 
<Sync time="295.121"/>
they pointed and gazed openmouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. 
<Sync time="300.152"/>
Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. 
<Sync time="304.343"/>
Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. 
<Sync time="309.216"/>
He yelled at five different people. 
<Sync time="310.811"/>
He made several important telephone calls 
<Sync time="313.076"/>
and shouted a bit more. 
<Sync time="314.478"/>
He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, 
<Sync time="316.934"/>
when he thought he'd stretch his legs 
<Sync time="319.152"/>
and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="322.395" endTime="344.523">
<Sync time="322.395"/>
He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. 
<Sync time="327.883"/>
He eyed them angrily as he passed. 
<Sync time="329.878"/>
He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. 
<Sync time="332.592"/>
This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, 
<Sync time="335.074"/>
and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. 
<Sync time="337.599"/>
It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, 
<Sync time="340.871"/>
that he caught a few words of what they were saying.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="344.523" endTime="352.237">
<Sync time="344.523"/>
"The Potters, 
<Sync time="345.768"/>
that's right, that's what I heard...
<Sync time="348.028"/>
yes, their son, Harry"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="352.237" endTime="362.558">
<Sync time="352.237"/>
Mr. Dursley stopped dead. 
<Sync time="355.474"/>
Fear flooded him. 
<Sync time="356.986"/>
He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, 
<Sync time="360.739"/>
but thought better of it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="362.558" endTime="414.574">
<Sync time="362.558"/>
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, 
<Sync time="366.193"/>
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, 
<Sync time="370.342"/>
and had almost finished dialing his home number 
<Sync time="374.709"/>
when he changed his mind. 
<Sync time="376.785"/>
He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... 
<Sync time="380.286"/>
no, he was being stupid. 
<Sync time="383.402"/>
Potter wasn't such an unusual name. 
<Sync time="386.32"/>
He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. 
<Sync time="391.484"/>
Come to think of it, 
<Sync time="392.951"/>
he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. 
<Sync time="396.085"/>
He'd never even seen the boy. 
<Sync time="397.742"/>
It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. 
<Sync time="400.394"/>
There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; 
<Sync time="402.844"/>
she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. 
<Sync time="406.484"/>
He didn't blame her — 
<Sync time="408.385"/>
if he'd had a sister like that... 
<Sync time="410.938"/>
but all the same, 
<Sync time="412.105"/>
those people in cloaks...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="414.574" endTime="425.251">
<Sync time="414.574"/>
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills 
<Sync time="417.229"/>
that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, 
<Sync time="419.779"/>
he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="425.251" endTime="459.225">
<Sync time="425.251"/>
"Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. 
<Sync time="429.908"/>
It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. 
<Sync time="434.917"/>
He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. 
<Sync time="437.003"/>
On the contrary, 
<Sync time="437.948"/>
his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, 
<Sync time="444.46"/>
"Don't be sorry, my dear sir, 
<Sync time="447.047"/>
for nothing could upset me today! 
<Sync time="449.773"/>
Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! 
<Sync time="454.924"/>
Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="459.225" endTime="463.293">
<Sync time="459.225"/>
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="463.293" endTime="487.747">
<Sync time="463.293"/>
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. 
<Sync time="466.707"/>
He had been hugged by a complete stranger. 
<Sync time="468.825"/>
He also thought he had been called a Muggle, 
<Sync time="471.572"/>
whatever that was. 
<Sync time="474.026"/>
He was rattled. 
<Sync time="475.569"/>
He hurried to his car 
<Sync time="477.448"/>
and set off for home, 
<Sync time="479.043"/>
hoping he was imagining things, 
<Sync time="482.689"/>
which he had never hoped before, 
<Sync time="484.845"/>
because he didn't approve of imagination.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="487.747" endTime="505.862">
<Sync time="487.747"/>
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- 
<Sync time="490.666"/>
and it didn't improve his mood — 
<Sync time="492.8"/>
was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. 
<Sync time="496.479"/>
It was now sitting on his garden wall. 
<Sync time="500.204"/>
He was sure it was the same one; 
<Sync time="502.13"/>
it had the same markings around its eyes.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="505.862" endTime="509.106">
<Sync time="505.862"/>
"Shoo!" 
<Sync time="506.718"/>
said Mr. Dursley loudly.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="509.106" endTime="526.542">
<Sync time="509.106"/>
The cat didn't move. 
<Sync time="511.226"/>
It just gave him a stern look. 
<Sync time="513.863"/>
Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. 
<Sync time="518.702"/>
Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. 
<Sync time="522.356"/>
He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="526.542" endTime="548.976">
<Sync time="526.542"/>
Mrs. Dursley 
<Sync time="527.707"/>
had had a nice, normal day. 
<Sync time="529.683"/>
She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter 
<Sync time="534.418"/>
and how Dudley had learned a new word 
<Sync time="537.701"/>
("Won't!"). 
<Sync time="540.179"/>
Mr. Dursley 
<Sync time="541.238"/>
tried to act normally. 
<Sync time="543.721"/>
When Dudley had been put to bed, 
<Sync time="545.586"/>
he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="548.976" endTime="587.045">
<Sync time="548.976"/>
"And finally, 
<Sync time="550.25"/>
bird-watchers everywhere 
<Sync time="552.496"/>
have reported that the nation's owls 
<Sync time="555.202"/>
have been behaving very unusually today. 
<Sync time="557.85"/>
Although owls normally hunt at night 
<Sync time="560.774"/>
and are hardly ever seen in daylight, 
<Sync time="563.343"/>
there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction 
<Sync time="567.678"/>
since sunrise. 
<Sync time="569.489"/>
Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern." 
<Sync time="575.477"/>
The newscaster allowed himself a grin. 
<Sync time="578.278"/>
"Most mysterious. 
<Sync time="580.059"/>
And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. 
<Sync time="583.582"/>
Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="587.045" endTime="614.313">
<Sync time="587.045"/>
"Well, Ted," 
<Sync time="588.288"/>
said the weatherman, 
<Sync time="589.591"/>
"I don't know about that, 
<Sync time="590.806"/>
but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. 
<Sync time="593.924"/>
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee 
<Sync time="597.674"/>
have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, 
<Sync time="601.105"/>
they've had a downpour of shooting stars! 
<Sync time="603.948"/>
Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — 
<Sync time="607.997"/>
it's not until next week, folks! 
<Sync time="610.573"/>
But I can promise a wet night tonight."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="614.313" endTime="628.718">
<Sync time="614.313"/>
Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. 
<Sync time="617.681"/>
Shooting stars all over Britain? 
<Sync time="620.74"/>
Owls flying by daylight? 
<Sync time="623.45"/>
Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="628.718" endTime="647.411">
<Sync time="628.718"/>
Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. 
<Sync time="631.738"/>
It was no good. 
<Sync time="633.276"/>
He'd have to say something to her. 
<Sync time="635.407"/>
He cleared his throat nervously. 
<Sync time="638.928"/>
"Er — 
<Sync time="640.172"/>
Petunia, dear — 
<Sync time="642.092"/>
you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="647.411" endTime="656.51">
<Sync time="647.411"/>
As he had expected, 
<Sync time="648.765"/>
Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. 
<Sync time="651.572"/>
After all, 
<Sync time="652.425"/>
they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="656.51" endTime="660.702">
<Sync time="656.51"/>
"No," 
<Sync time="657.269"/>
she said sharply. 
<Sync time="659.113"/>
"Why?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="660.702" endTime="671.185">
<Sync time="660.702"/>
"Funny stuff on the news," 
<Sync time="663.345"/>
Mr. Dursley mumbled. 
<Sync time="665.048"/>
"Owls... shooting stars... 
<Sync time="667.443"/>
and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="671.185" endTime="674.268">
<Sync time="671.185"/>
"So?" 
<Sync time="672.094"/>
snapped Mrs. Dursley.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="674.268" endTime="681.225">
<Sync time="674.268"/>
"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="681.225" endTime="698.713">
<Sync time="681.225"/>
Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. 
<Sync time="684.34"/>
Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name "Potter." 
<Sync time="688.878"/>
He decided he didn't dare. 
<Sync time="691.193"/>
Instead he said, as casually as he could, 
<Sync time="694.173"/>
"Their son -- he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="698.713" endTime="701.978">
<Sync time="698.713"/>
"I suppose so," 
<Sync time="699.58"/>
said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="701.978" endTime="705.31">
<Sync time="701.978"/>
"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="705.31" endTime="709.386">
<Sync time="705.31"/>
"Harry. 
<Sync time="705.965"/>
Nasty, common name, if you ask me."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="709.386" endTime="717.767">
<Sync time="709.386"/>
"Oh, yes," 
<Sync time="711.089"/>
said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. 
<Sync time="714.876"/>
"Yes, 
<Sync time="715.826"/>
I quite agree."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="717.767" endTime="737.649">
<Sync time="717.767"/>
He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. 
<Sync time="722.001"/>
While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, 
<Sync time="724.767"/>
Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window 
<Sync time="728.229"/>
and peered down into the front garden. 
<Sync time="730.883"/>
The cat was still there. 
<Sync time="733.428"/>
It was staring down Privet Drive 
<Sync time="735.669"/>
as though it were waiting for something.

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="737.649" endTime="752.13">
<Sync time="737.649"/>
Was he imagining things? 
<Sync time="739.581"/>
Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? 
<Sync time="742.826"/>
If it did... 
<Sync time="744.27"/>
if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- 
<Sync time="747.535"/>
well, 
<Sync time="748.957"/>
he didn't think he could bear it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="752.13" endTime="791.054">
<Sync time="752.13"/>
The Dursleys got into bed. 
<Sync time="754.445"/>
Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly 
<Sync time="757.234"/>
but Mr. Dursley lay awake, 
<Sync time="759.471"/>
turning it all over in his mind. 
<Sync time="762.48"/>
His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that 
<Sync time="766.287"/>
even if the Potters were involved, 
<Sync time="769.046"/>
there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. 
<Sync time="772.051"/>
The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind.... 
<Sync time="776.623"/>
He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — 
<Sync time="781.528"/>
he yawned and turned over -- 
<Sync time="786.802"/>
it couldn't affect them....
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="791.054" endTime="793.834">

How very wrong he was.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="793.834" endTime="818.698">
<Sync time="793.834"/>
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, 
<Sync time="796.416"/>
but the cat on the wall outside 
<Sync time="799.007"/>
was showing no sign of sleepiness. 
<Sync time="801.487"/>
It was sitting as still as a statue, 
<Sync time="803.626"/>
its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. 
<Sync time="808.191"/>
It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, 
<Sync time="812.062"/>
nor when two owls swooped overhead. 
<Sync time="815.02"/>
In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="818.698" endTime="832.993">
<Sync time="818.698"/>
A man 
<Sync time="819.735"/>
appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, 
<Sync time="822.446"/>
appeared so suddenly and silently 
<Sync time="825.501"/>
you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. 
<Sync time="828.699"/>
The cat's tail twitched 
<Sync time="830.401"/>
and its eyes narrowed.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="832.993" endTime="867.353">
<Sync time="832.993"/>
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. 
<Sync time="836.162"/>
He was tall, thin, and very old, 
<Sync time="838.458"/>
judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. 
<Sync time="844.798"/>
He was wearing long robes, 
<Sync time="846.336"/>
a purple cloak that swept the ground, 
<Sync time="848.748"/>
and high-heeled, buckled boots. 
<Sync time="851.228"/>
His blue eyes were light, bright, 
<Sync time="853.993"/>
and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and 
<Sync time="857.961"/>
his nose was very long and crooked, 
<Sync time="860.237"/>
as though it had been broken at least twice. 
<Sync time="863.06"/>
This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="867.353" endTime="899.47">
<Sync time="867.353"/>
Albus Dumbledore 
<Sync time="868.651"/>
didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street 
<Sync time="871.593"/>
where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. 
<Sync time="877.171"/>
He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. 
<Sync time="880.598"/>
But he did seem to realize he was being watched, 
<Sync time="883.049"/>
because he looked up suddenly at the cat, 
<Sync time="885.618"/>
which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. 
<Sync time="890.393"/>
For some reason, 
<Sync time="891.446"/>
the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. 
<Sync time="893.562"/>
He chuckled and muttered, 
<Sync time="896.601"/>
"I should have known."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="899.47" endTime="950.344">
<Sync time="899.47"/>
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. 
<Sync time="902.32"/>
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. 
<Sync time="904.297"/>
He flicked it open, 
<Sync time="905.341"/>
held it up in the air, 
<Sync time="906.808"/>
and clicked it. 
<Sync time="908.561"/>
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. 
<Sync time="912.569"/>
He clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into darkness. 
<Sync time="916.042"/>
Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, 
<Sync time="918.541"/>
until the only lights left on the whole street 
<Sync time="921.561"/>
were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, 
<Sync time="923.784"/>
which were the eyes of the cat watching him. 
<Sync time="927.365"/>
If anyone looked out of their window now, 
<Sync time="929.864"/>
even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, 
<Sync time="934.434"/>
they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. 
<Sync time="938.257"/>
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak 
<Sync time="941.3"/>
and set off down the street toward number four, 
<Sync time="943.019"/>
where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. 
<Sync time="945.701"/>
He didn't look at it, 
<Sync time="946.658"/>
but after a moment he spoke to it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="950.344" endTime="954.308">
<Sync time="950.344"/>
"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="954.308" endTime="975.814">
<Sync time="954.308"/>
He turned to smile at the tabby, 
<Sync time="956.148"/>
but it had gone. 
<Sync time="957.573"/>
Instead 
<Sync time="958.618"/>
he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. 
<Sync time="967.31"/>
She, too, was wearing a cloak, 
<Sync time="969.093"/>
an emerald one. 
<Sync time="970.639"/>
Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. 
<Sync time="973.144"/>
She looked distinctly ruffled.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="975.814" endTime="978.744">
<Sync time="975.814"/>
"How did you know it was me?"

she asked.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="978.744" endTime="983.212">
<Sync time="978.744"/>
"My dear Professor,

I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="983.212" endTime="989.438">
<Sync time="983.212"/>
"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day," 
<Sync time="987.203"/>
said Professor McGonagall.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="989.438" endTime="998.223">
<Sync time="989.438"/>
"All day? 
<Sync time="990.865"/>
When you could have been celebrating? 
<Sync time="993.261"/>
I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties 
<Sync time="996.176"/>
on my way here."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="998.223" endTime="1001.092">
<Sync time="998.223"/>
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1001.092" endTime="1031.839">
<Sync time="1001.092"/>
"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right," 
<Sync time="1003.563"/>
she said impatiently. 
<Sync time="1005.182"/>
"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no — 
<Sync time="1007.935"/>
even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. 
<Sync time="1010.83"/>
It was on their news." 
<Sync time="1013.252"/>
She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. 
<Sync time="1017.384"/>
"I heard it. 
<Sync time="1018.653"/>
Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... 
<Sync time="1021.341"/>
Well, they're not completely stupid. 
<Sync time="1023.35"/>
They were bound to notice something. 
<Sync time="1025.218"/>
Shooting stars down in Kent — 
<Sync time="1028.022"/>
I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. 
<Sync time="1029.672"/>
He never had much sense."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1031.839" endTime="1040.328">
<Sync time="1031.839"/>
"You can't blame them," 
<Sync time="1034.083"/>
said Dumbledore gently. 
<Sync time="1036.534"/>
"We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1040.328" endTime="1055.914">
<Sync time="1040.328"/>
"I know that," said Professor McGonagall irritably. 
<Sync time="1043.458"/>
"But that's no reason to lose our heads. 
<Sync time="1046.248"/>
People are being downright careless, 
<Sync time="1049.128"/>
out on the streets in broad daylight, 
<Sync time="1051.436"/>
not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1055.914" endTime="1078.46">
<Sync time="1055.914"/>
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, 
<Sync time="1058.791"/>
as though hoping he was going to tell her something, 
<Sync time="1061.867"/>
but he didn't, 
<Sync time="1063.139"/>
so she went on. 
<Sync time="1064.774"/>
"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, 
<Sync time="1070.514"/>
the Muggles found out about us all. 
<Sync time="1073.972"/>
I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1078.46" endTime="1087.291">
<Sync time="1078.46"/>
"It certainly seems so," 
<Sync time="1080.134"/>
said Dumbledore. 
<Sync time="1081.741"/>
"We have much to be thankful for. 
<Sync time="1084.352"/>
Would you care for a lemon drop?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1087.291" endTime="1088.843">

"A what?"

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1088.843" endTime="1094.567">

They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1094.567" endTime="1106.561">
<Sync time="1094.567"/>
"No, thank you," 
<Sync time="1096.337"/>
said Professor McGonagall coldly, 
<Sync time="1098.604"/>
as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops. 
<Sync time="1102.378"/>
"As I say, 
<Sync time="1103.702"/>
even if You-Know-Who has gone — "
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1106.561" endTime="1142.896">
<Sync time="1106.561"/>
"My dear Professor, 
<Sync time="1108.437"/>
surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? 
<Sync time="1114.708"/>
All this 'You-Know-Who' nonsense — 
<Sync time="1117.935"/>
for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: 
<Sync time="1123.296"/>
Voldemort." 
<Sync time="1125.593"/>
Professor McGonagall flinched, 
<Sync time="1128.237"/>
but Dumbledore, 
<Sync time="1129.205"/>
who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. 
<Sync time="1133.242"/>
"It all gets so confusing 
<Sync time="1135.439"/>
if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.'

I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.

"I know you haven't,"

said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring.

"But you're different.

Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know-oh,

all right, Voldemort, was frightened of."

"You flatter me,"

said Dumbledore calmly.

"Voldemort had powers I will never have."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1164.195" endTime="1169.695">

well —

noble

to use them."

I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1177.644" endTime="1192.302">
<Sync time="1177.644"/>
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, 
<Sync time="1180.96"/>
"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. 
<Sync time="1185.696"/>
You know what everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared?

About what finally stopped him?"

It seemed that Professor McGonagall

had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, 
<Sync time="1197.352"/>
the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, 
<Sync time="1200.948"/>
for neither as a cat nor as a woman 
<Sync time="1202.96"/>
had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. 
<Sync time="1207.896"/>
It was plain that whatever "everyone" was saying, 
<Sync time="1211.622"/>
she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. 
<Sync time="1215.479"/>
Dumbledore, however, 
<Sync time="1216.931"/>
was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1220.466" endTime="1236.331">
<Sync time="1220.466"/>
"What they're saying,"

she pressed on, 
<Sync time="1223.362"/>
"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. 
<Sync time="1226.468"/>
He went to find the Potters.

The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are —

dead. "
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1236.331" endTime="1242.807">

Dumbledore bowed his head.

Professor McGonagall gasped.

"Lily and James...

Oh, Albus..."

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1248.86" endTime="1256.917">

"I know...

I know..."

he said heavily.

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1256.917" endTime="1277.697">

Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on.

"That's not all.

They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry.

But — he couldn't.

He couldn't kill that little boy.

No one knows why, or how, 
<Sync time="1270.122"/>
but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, 
<Sync time="1272.1"/>
Voldemort's power somehow broke —

and that's why he's gone.

"After all he's done...

all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy?

It's just astounding...

of all the things to stop him...

how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?"

Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief

and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles.

Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it.

It was a very odd watch.

It had twelve hands but no numbers; 
<Sync time="1324.291"/>
instead, little planets were moving around the edge.

It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,

"Hagrid's late.

"Yes,"

you can't mean the people who live here?"

cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.

"Dumbledore — you can't.

I've been watching them all day.

You couldn't find two people who are less like us.

And they've got this son —

Harry Potter come and live here!"

"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? 
<Sync time="1396.236"/>
These people will never understand him!

He'll be famous —

a legend — I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future —

there will be books written about Harry — 
<Sync time="1406.749"/>
every child in our world will know his name!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1410.269" endTime="1430.963">
<Sync time="1410.269"/>
"Exactly," 
<Sync time="1411.933"/>
said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. 
<Sync time="1415.557"/>
"It would be enough to turn any boy's head. 
<Sync time="1418.599"/>
Famous before he can walk and talk! 
<Sync time="1421.179"/>
Famous for something he won't even remember! 
<Sync time="1423.889"/>
Can you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that 
<Sync time="1427.844"/>
until he's ready to take it?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1430.963" endTime="1448.762">
<Sync time="1430.963"/>
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, 
<Sync time="1432.952"/>
changed her mind, 
<Sync time="1433.938"/>
swallowed, 
<Sync time="1434.934"/>
and then said, 
<Sync time="1436.638"/>
"Yes — 
<Sync time="1437.605"/>
yes, 
<Sync time="1438.128"/>
you're right, of course. 
<Sync time="1439.926"/>
But 
<Sync time="1440.661"/>
how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?" 
<Sync time="1443.556"/>
She eyed his cloak suddenly 
<Sync time="1445.491"/>
as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1448.762" endTime="1451.306">
<Sync time="1448.762"/>
"Hagrid's bringing him."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1451.306" endTime="1456.259">
<Sync time="1451.306"/>
"You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1456.259" endTime="1460.067">
<Sync time="1456.259"/>
I would trust Hagrid with my life," 
<Sync time="1458.809"/>
said Dumbledore.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1460.067" endTime="1471.86">
<Sync time="1460.067"/>
"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place," 
<Sync time="1463.215"/>
said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, 
<Sync time="1465.553"/>
"but you can't pretend he's not careless. 
<Sync time="1467.532"/>
He does tend to — 
<Sync time="1469.937"/>
what was that?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1471.86" endTime="1490.131">
<Sync time="1471.86"/>
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. 
<Sync time="1475.255"/>
It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; 
<Sync time="1480.127"/>
it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — 
<Sync time="1484.681"/>
and a huge motorcycle 
<Sync time="1486.366"/>
fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1490.131" endTime="1526.057">
<Sync time="1490.131"/>
If the motorcycle was huge, 
<Sync time="1492.162"/>
it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. 
<Sync time="1496.01"/>
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man 
<Sync time="1498.775"/>
and at least five times as wide. 
<Sync time="1501.33"/>
He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, 
<Sync time="1511.698"/>
he had hands the size of trash can lids, 
<Sync time="1515.808"/>
and his feet 
<Sync time="1516.715"/>
in their leather boots 
<Sync time="1518.333"/>
were like baby dolphins. 
<Sync time="1520.63"/>
In his vast, muscular arms 
<Sync time="1523.026"/>
he was holding a bundle of blankets.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1526.057" endTime="1532.815">
<Sync time="1526.057"/>
"Hagrid," 
<Sync time="1527.288"/>
said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. 
<Sync time="1528.848"/>
"At last. 
<Sync time="1530.353"/>
And where did you get that motorcycle?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1532.815" endTime="1544.228">
<Sync time="1532.815"/>
"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir," 
<Sync time="1535.574"/>
said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. 
<Sync time="1539.741"/>
"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. 
<Sync time="1542.218"/>
I've got him, sir."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1544.228" endTime="1546.542">
<Sync time="1544.228"/>
"No problems, were there?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1546.542" endTime="1556.501">
<Sync time="1546.542"/>
"No, sir — 
<Sync time="1548.071"/>
house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around. 
<Sync time="1552.928"/>
He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1556.501" endTime="1573.66">
<Sync time="1556.501"/>
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall 
<Sync time="1558.384"/>
bent forward over the bundle of blankets. 
<Sync time="1560.838"/>
Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. 
<Sync time="1565.289"/>
Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, 
<Sync time="1571.219"/>
like a bolt of lightning.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1573.66" endTime="1578.052">
<Sync time="1573.66"/>
"Is that where -?" 
<Sync time="1575.352"/>
whispered Professor McGonagall.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1578.052" endTime="1584.023">
<Sync time="1578.052"/>
"Yes," 
<Sync time="1579.013"/>
said Dumbledore. 
<Sync time="1580.661"/>
"He'll have that scar forever."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1584.023" endTime="1586.787">
<Sync time="1584.023"/>
"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1586.787" endTime="1602.776">
<Sync time="1586.787"/>
"Even if I could, I wouldn't. 
<Sync time="1589.029"/>
Scars can come in handy. 
<Sync time="1591.279"/>
I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. 
<Sync time="1596.768"/>
Well -- 
<Sync time="1597.919"/>
give him here, Hagrid — 
<Sync time="1599.748"/>
we'd better get this over with."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1602.776" endTime="1606.608">
<Sync time="1602.776"/>
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1606.608" endTime="1612.331">
<Sync time="1606.608"/>
"Could I — 
<Sync time="1608.025"/>
could I say good-bye to him, sir?" 
<Sync time="1610.543"/>
asked Hagrid.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1612.331" endTime="1625.11">
<Sync time="1612.331"/>
He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry 
<Sync time="1615.255"/>
and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. 
<Sync time="1618.294"/>
Then, 
<Sync time="1619.405"/>
suddenly, 
<Sync time="1620.968"/>
Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1625.11" endTime="1630.781">
<Sync time="1625.11"/>
"Shhh!" 
<Sync time="1626.634"/>
hissed Professor McGonagall, 
<Sync time="1628.378"/>
"you'll wake the Muggles!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1630.781" endTime="1644.004">
<Sync time="1630.781"/>
"S-s-sorry," 
<Sync time="1632.655"/>
sobbed Hagrid, 
<Sync time="1633.867"/>
taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. 
<Sync time="1636.173"/>
"But I c-c-can't stand it — 
<Sync time="1638.537"/>
Lily an' James dead -- 
<Sync time="1640.491"/>
an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles — "
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1644.004" endTime="1683.813">
<Sync time="1644.004"/>
"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found," 
<Sync time="1649.056"/>
Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm 
<Sync time="1652.733"/>
as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall 
<Sync time="1655.577"/>
and walked to the front door. 
<Sync time="1658.228"/>
He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, 
<Sync time="1660.744"/>
took a letter out of his cloak, 
<Sync time="1662.546"/>
tucked it inside Harry's blankets, 
<Sync time="1664.811"/>
and then came back to the other two. 
<Sync time="1668.24"/>
For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; 
<Sync time="1672.188"/>
Hagrid's shoulders shook, 
<Sync time="1674.93"/>
Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, 
<Sync time="1677.986"/>
and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1683.813" endTime="1694.055">
<Sync time="1683.813"/>
"Well," 
<Sync time="1684.832"/>
said Dumbledore finally, 
<Sync time="1686.602"/>
"that's that. 
<Sync time="1687.782"/>
We've no business staying here. 
<Sync time="1689.998"/>
We may as well go and join the celebrations."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1694.055" endTime="1704.394">
<Sync time="1694.055"/>
"Yeah," 
<Sync time="1695.052"/>
said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, 
<Sync time="1697.578"/>
"I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back. 
<Sync time="1699.774"/>
G'night, Professor McGonagall — 
<Sync time="1702.141"/>
Professor Dumbledore, sir."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1704.394" endTime="1715.537">
<Sync time="1704.394"/>
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, 
<Sync time="1707.391"/>
Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; 
<Sync time="1711.282"/>
with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1715.537" endTime="1725.863">
<Sync time="1715.537"/>
"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall," 
<Sync time="1718.889"/>
said Dumbledore, nodding to her. 
<Sync time="1722.12"/>
Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1725.863" endTime="1750.944">
<Sync time="1725.863"/>
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. 
<Sync time="1728.658"/>
On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. 
<Sync time="1732.116"/>
He clicked it once, 
<Sync time="1733.534"/>
and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps 
<Sync time="1736.042"/>
so that Privet Drive 
<Sync time="1737.619"/>
glowed suddenly orange 
<Sync time="1740.459"/>
and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner 
<Sync time="1743.413"/>
at the other end of the street. 
<Sync time="1746.312"/>
He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1750.944" endTime="1758.95">
<Sync time="1750.944"/>
"Good luck, Harry," 
<Sync time="1753.0"/>
he murmured. 
<Sync time="1754.347"/>
He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1758.95" endTime="1808.184">
<Sync time="1758.95"/>
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, 
<Sync time="1762.126"/>
which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, 
<Sync time="1765.892"/>
the very last place 
<Sync time="1767.582"/>
you would expect astonishing things to happen. 
<Sync time="1771.078"/>
Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. 
<Sync time="1774.794"/>
One small hand closed on the letter beside him 
<Sync time="1776.987"/>
and he slept on, 
<Sync time="1778.613"/>
not knowing he was special, 
<Sync time="1780.367"/>
not knowing he was famous, 
<Sync time="1782.171"/>
not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, 
<Sync time="1788.404"/>
nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... 
<Sync time="1793.197"/>
He couldn't know that at this very moment, 
<Sync time="1796.779"/>
people meeting in secret all over the country 
<Sync time="1799.798"/>
were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: 
<Sync time="1803.468"/>
"To Harry Potter — 
<Sync time="1805.091"/>
the boy who lived!"
