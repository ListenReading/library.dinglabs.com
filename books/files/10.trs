DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE
</Turn>

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="27.064" endTime="45.564">
<Sync time="27.064"/>
Alice was beginning to get very tired 
<Sync time="29.44"/>
of sitting by her sister on the bank, 
<Sync time="31.876"/>
and of having nothing to do. 
<Sync time="34.486"/>
Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, 
<Sync time="37.83"/>
but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 
<Sync time="40.517"/>
"and what is the use of a book," thought Alice, 
<Sync time="42.955"/>
"without pictures or conversations?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="45.564" endTime="60.358">
<Sync time="45.564"/>
So she was considering in her own mind 
<Sync time="47.689"/>
(as well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), 
<Sync time="51.518"/>
whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, 
<Sync time="56.643"/>
when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="60.358" endTime="61.205">
<Sync time="60.358"/>
i002_th.jpg
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="61.205" endTime="98.386">
<Sync time="61.205"/>
There was nothing so very remarkable in that, 
<Sync time="63.737"/>
nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 
<Sync time="67.753"/>
"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" 
<Sync time="70.784"/>
But when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it 
<Sync time="75.41"/>
and then hurried on, 
<Sync time="76.926"/>
Alice started to her feet, 
<Sync time="78.66"/>
for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, 
<Sync time="86.02"/>
and, burning with curiosity, 
<Sync time="87.948"/>
she ran across the field after it 
<Sync time="89.932"/>
and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under the hedge. 
<Sync time="94.418"/>
In another moment, 
<Sync time="95.699"/>
down went Alice after it!
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="98.386" endTime="113.105">
<Sync time="98.386"/>
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way 
<Sync time="101.433"/>
and then dipped suddenly down, 
<Sync time="103.214"/>
so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be 
<Sync time="110.058"/>
a very deep well.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="113.105" endTime="146.919">
<Sync time="113.105"/>
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, 
<Sync time="116.574"/>
for she had plenty of time, as she went down, to look about her. 
<Sync time="120.027"/>
First, she tried to make out what she was coming to, 
<Sync time="122.855"/>
but it was too dark to see anything; 
<Sync time="125.012"/>
then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; 
<Sync time="129.731"/>
here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. 
<Sync time="132.98"/>
She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed. 
<Sync time="136.137"/>
It was labeled "ORANGE MARMALADE," 
<Sync time="138.324"/>
but, to her great disappointment, 
<Sync time="139.966"/>
it was empty; 
<Sync time="141.044"/>
she did not like to drop the jar, 
<Sync time="143.013"/>
so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="146.919" endTime="173.966">
<Sync time="146.919"/>
Down, down, down! 
<Sync time="148.512"/>
Would the fall never come to an end? 
<Sync time="150.684"/>
There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking to herself. 
<Sync time="154.481"/>
"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!" 
<Sync time="157.246"/>
(Dinah was the cat.) 
<Sync time="158.981"/>
"I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. 
<Sync time="161.95"/>
Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!" 
<Sync time="164.669"/>
Alice felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, 
<Sync time="167.809"/>
thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, 
<Sync time="171.528"/>
and the fall was over.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="173.966" endTime="201.808">
<Sync time="173.966"/>
Alice was not a bit hurt, 
<Sync time="175.731"/>
and she jumped up in a moment. 
<Sync time="177.715"/>
She looked up, but it was all dark overhead; 
<Sync time="179.965"/>
before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. 
<Sync time="185.246"/>
There was not a moment to be lost. 
<Sync time="187.324"/>
Away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 
<Sync time="192.433"/>
"Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!" 
<Sync time="195.809"/>
She was close behind it when she turned the corner, 
<Sync time="198.808"/>
but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="201.808" endTime="220.731">
<Sync time="201.808"/>
She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. 
<Sync time="208.105"/>
There were doors all 'round the hall, 
<Sync time="210.152"/>
but they were all locked; 
<Sync time="211.497"/>
and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, 
<Sync time="216.028"/>
she walked sadly down the middle, 
<Sync time="217.935"/>
wondering how she was ever to get out again.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="220.731" endTime="253.322">
<Sync time="220.731"/>
Suddenly she came upon a little table, 
<Sync time="223.778"/>
all made of solid glass. 
<Sync time="226.012"/>
There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, 
<Sync time="228.839"/>
and Alice's first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; 
<Sync time="233.245"/>
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, 
<Sync time="237.198"/>
but, at any rate, it would not open any of them. 
<Sync time="239.885"/>
However, on the second time 'round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, 
<Sync time="244.572"/>
and behind it 
<Sync time="245.589"/>
was a little door about fifteen inches high. 
<Sync time="248.229"/>
She tried the little golden key in the lock, 
<Sync time="250.401"/>
and to her great delight, it fitted!
</Turn>
<Turn startTime="253.322" endTime="281.464" speaker="spk1">
<Sync time="253.322"/>
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, 
<Sync time="257.26"/>
not much larger than a rat-hole; 
<Sync time="259.463"/>
she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. 
<Sync time="263.901"/>
How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, 
<Sync time="271.495"/>
but she could not even get her head through the doorway. 
<Sync time="274.166"/>
"Oh," said Alice, "how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! 
<Sync time="278.026"/>
I think I could, if I only knew how to begin."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="281.464" endTime="303.012">
<Sync time="281.464"/>
Alice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, 
<Sync time="285.51"/>
or at any rate, 
<Sync time="286.729"/>
a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. 
<Sync time="289.682"/>
This time she found a little bottle on it 
<Sync time="292.761"/>
("which certainly was not here before," said Alice), 
<Sync time="295.543"/>
and tied 'round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, 
<Sync time="298.325"/>
with the words 
<Sync time="299.121"/>
"DRINK ME" 
<Sync time="299.856"/>
beautifully printed on it in large letters.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="303.012" endTime="329.967">
<Sync time="303.012"/>
"No, I'll look first," she said, "and see whether it's marked 'poison' or not," 
<Sync time="307.387"/>
for she had never forgotten that, 
<Sync time="309.308"/>
if you drink from a bottle marked "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. 
<Sync time="314.667"/>
However, this bottle was not marked "poison," 
<Sync time="316.934"/>
so Alice ventured to taste it, 
<Sync time="318.794"/>
and, finding it very nice 
<Sync time="320.513"/>
(it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered toast), 
<Sync time="326.858"/>
she very soon finished it off.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="329.967" endTime="335.326">
<Sync time="329.967"/>
"What a curious feeling!" said Alice. 
<Sync time="332.607"/>
"I must be shutting up like a telescope!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="335.326" endTime="346.404">
<Sync time="335.326"/>
And so it was indeed! 
<Sync time="337.294"/>
She was now only ten inches high, 
<Sync time="339.388"/>
and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="346.404" endTime="375.796">
<Sync time="346.404"/>
After awhile, 
<Sync time="347.685"/>
finding that nothing more happened, 
<Sync time="349.731"/>
she decided on going into the garden at once; 
<Sync time="352.387"/>
but, alas for poor Alice! 
<Sync time="354.262"/>
When she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, 
<Sync time="358.371"/>
and when she went back to the table for it, 
<Sync time="360.652"/>
she found she could not possibly reach it: 
<Sync time="363.511"/>
she could see it quite plainly through the glass 
<Sync time="365.996"/>
and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, 
<Sync time="369.465"/>
but it was too slippery, 
<Sync time="370.918"/>
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="375.796" endTime="376.308">
<Sync time="375.796"/>
i003_th.jpg
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="376.308" endTime="393.634">
<Sync time="376.308"/>
"Come, there's no use in crying like that!" said Alice to herself rather sharply. 
<Sync time="380.713"/>
"I advise you to leave off this minute!" 
<Sync time="383.744"/>
She generally gave herself very good advice 
<Sync time="386.337"/>
(though she very seldom followed it), 
<Sync time="388.259"/>
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="393.634" endTime="418.212">
<Sync time="393.634"/>
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: 
<Sync time="397.806"/>
she opened it and found in it a very small cake, 
<Sync time="401.166"/>
on which the words "EAT ME" 
<Sync time="403.025"/>
were beautifully marked in currants. 
<Sync time="405.806"/>
"Well, I'll eat it," said Alice, 
<Sync time="407.728"/>
"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; 
<Sync time="410.354"/>
and if it makes me grow smaller, 
<Sync time="412.026"/>
I can creep under the door: 
<Sync time="413.855"/>
so either way I'll get into the garden, 
<Sync time="415.931"/>
and I don't care which happens!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="418.212" endTime="436.367">
<Sync time="418.212"/>
She ate a little bit 
<Sync time="419.65"/>
and said anxiously to herself, 
<Sync time="421.478"/>
"Which way? Which way?" 
<Sync time="423.133"/>
holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing; 
<Sync time="426.775"/>
and she was quite surprised to find 
<Sync time="428.712"/>
that she remained the same size. 
<Sync time="431.212"/>
So she set to work 
<Sync time="432.68"/>
and very soon finished off the cake.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="436.367" endTime="443.220">
<Sync time="436.367"/>
