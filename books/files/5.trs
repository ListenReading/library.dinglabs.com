EFFECT OF THOUGHT ON HEALTH AND THE BODY
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="23.627" endTime="45.484">
<Sync time="23.627"/>
THE body is the servant of the mind. 
<Sync time="26.27"/>
It obeys the operations of the mind, 
<Sync time="28.895"/>
whether they be deliberately chosen or automatically expressed. 
<Sync time="33.403"/>
At the bidding of unlawful thoughts the body sinks rapidly into disease and decay; 
<Sync time="38.774"/>
at the command of glad and beautiful thoughts 
<Sync time="41.444"/>
it becomes clothed 
<Sync time="42.633"/>
with youthfulness and beauty.
</Turn>
<Turn startTime="45.484" endTime="82.494" speaker="spk1">
<Sync time="45.484"/>
Disease and health, 
<Sync time="47.123"/>
like circumstances, 
<Sync time="48.641"/>
are rooted in thought. 
<Sync time="50.748"/>
Sickly thoughts will express themselves 
<Sync time="53.08"/>
through a sickly body. 
<Sync time="55.169"/>
Thoughts of fear have been known to kill a man as speedily as a bullet, 
<Sync time="59.476"/>
and they are continually killing thousands of people just as surely 
<Sync time="63.517"/>
though less rapidly. 
<Sync time="65.317"/>
The people who live in fear of disease are the people who get it. 
<Sync time="69.009"/>
Anxiety quickly demoralizes the whole body, 
<Sync time="72.445"/>
and lays it open to the entrance of disease; 
<Sync time="75.541"/>
while impure thoughts, 
<Sync time="77.3"/>
even if not physically indulged, 
<Sync time="79.65"/>
will soon shatter the nervous system.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="82.494" endTime="99.914">
<Sync time="82.494"/>
Strong, 
<Sync time="83.334"/>
pure, 
<Sync time="83.847"/>
and happy thoughts build up the body in vigour and grace. 
<Sync time="87.897"/>
The body is a delicate and plastic instrument, 
<Sync time="90.595"/>
which responds readily to the thoughts by which it is impressed, 
<Sync time="94.078"/>
and habits of thought will produce their own effects, 
<Sync time="96.843"/>
good or bad, 
<Sync time="97.681"/>
upon it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="99.914" endTime="123.346">
<Sync time="99.914"/>
Men will continue to have impure and poisoned blood, so long as they propagate unclean thoughts. 
<Sync time="106.383"/>
Out of a clean heart comes a clean life and a clean body. 
<Sync time="110.215"/>
Out of a defiled mind proceeds a defiled life 
<Sync time="113.276"/>
and a corrupt body. 
<Sync time="115.188"/>
Thought is the fount of action, 
<Sync time="117.133"/>
life, and manifestation; 
<Sync time="119.313"/>
make the fountain pure, 
<Sync time="120.855"/>
and all will be pure.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="123.346" endTime="132.299">
<Sync time="123.346"/>
Change of diet will not help a man who will not change his thoughts. 
<Sync time="127.779"/>
When a man makes his thoughts pure, 
<Sync time="129.813"/>
he no longer desires impure food.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="132.299" endTime="132.826">
<Sync time="132.299"/>
Clean thoughts make clean habits. The so-called saint who does not wash his body is not a saint. He who has strengthened and purified his thoughts does not need to consider the malevolent microbe.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="132.826" endTime="157.106">
<Sync time="132.826"/>
If you would protect your body, 
<Sync time="134.714"/>
guard your mind. 
<Sync time="136.367"/>
If you would renew your body, 
<Sync time="138.165"/>
beautify your mind. 
<Sync time="140.085"/>
Thoughts of malice, 
<Sync time="141.513"/>
envy, 
<Sync time="142.249"/>
disappointment, 
<Sync time="143.279"/>
despondency, 
<Sync time="144.388"/>
rob the body of its health and grace. 
<Sync time="147.276"/>
A sour face does not come by chance; 
<Sync time="150.028"/>
it is made by sour thoughts. 
<Sync time="152.548"/>
Wrinkles that mar 
<Sync time="153.834"/>
are drawn by folly, 
<Sync time="155.334"/>
passion, and pride.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="157.106" endTime="176.656">
<Sync time="157.106"/>
I know a woman of ninety-six 
<Sync time="159.082"/>
who has the bright, innocent face of a girl. 
<Sync time="162.934"/>
I know a man well under middle age whose face is drawn into inharmonious contours. 
<Sync time="168.572"/>
The one is the result of a sweet and sunny disposition; 
<Sync time="172.377"/>
the other is the outcome of passion and discontent.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="176.656" endTime="196.352">
<Sync time="176.656"/>
As you cannot have a sweet and wholesome abode unless you admit the air and sunshine freely into your rooms, 
<Sync time="183.362"/>
so a strong body and a bright, happy, 
<Sync time="186.481"/>
or serene countenance 
<Sync time="187.943"/>
can only result from the free admittance into the mind of thoughts of joy and goodwill 
<Sync time="193.08"/>
and serenity.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="196.352" endTime="225.736">
<Sync time="196.352"/>
On the faces of the aged there are wrinkles made by sympathy, 
<Sync time="199.987"/>
others by strong and pure thought, 
<Sync time="202.333"/>
and others are carved by passion: 
<Sync time="204.498"/>
who cannot distinguish them? 
<Sync time="207.136"/>
With those who have lived righteously, 
<Sync time="209.18"/>
age is calm, 
<Sync time="210.237"/>
peaceful, 
<Sync time="210.99"/>
and softly mellowed, 
<Sync time="212.299"/>
like the setting sun. 
<Sync time="214.351"/>
I have recently seen a philosopher on his deathbed. 
<Sync time="218.272"/>
He was not old except in years. 
<Sync time="221.037"/>
He died as sweetly 
<Sync time="222.515"/>
and peacefully 
<Sync time="223.562"/>
as he had lived.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="225.736" endTime="270.838">
<Sync time="225.736"/>
There is no physician 
<Sync time="227.284"/>
like cheerful thought 
<Sync time="228.459"/>
for dissipating the ills of the body; 
<Sync time="231.097"/>
there is no comforter to compare with goodwill for dispersing the shadows of grief and sorrow. 
<Sync time="237.284"/>
To live continually in thoughts of ill will, 
<Sync time="239.97"/>
cynicism, suspicion, and envy, 
<Sync time="242.528"/>
is to be confined in a self made prison-hole. 
<Sync time="245.786"/>
But to think well of all, 
<Sync time="247.502"/>
to be cheerful with all, 
<Sync time="249.583"/>
to patiently learn to find the good in allâ€”
<Sync time="252.243"/>
such unselfish thoughts are the very portals of heaven; 
<Sync time="255.858"/>
and to dwell day by day in thoughts of peace toward every creature 
<Sync time="259.619"/>
will bring abounding peace to their possessor.
<Sync time="263.128"/>
