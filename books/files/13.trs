THE RABBIT SENDS IN 
<Sync time="24.749"/>
A LITTLE BILL

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="27.624" endTime="67.343">
<Sync time="27.624"/>
It was the White Rabbit, 
<Sync time="29.155"/>
trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went, 
<Sync time="33.561"/>
as if it had lost something; 
<Sync time="35.483"/>
Alice heard it muttering to itself, 
<Sync time="37.733"/>
"The Duchess! The Duchess! 
<Sync time="39.514"/>
Oh, my dear paws! 
<Sync time="41.014"/>
Oh, my fur and whiskers! 
<Sync time="42.764"/>
She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! 
<Sync time="46.155"/>
Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?" 
<Sync time="49.139"/>
Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan 
<Sync time="52.217"/>
and the pair of white kid-gloves 
<Sync time="54.045"/>
and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, 
<Sync time="57.077"/>
but they were nowhere to be seen—
<Sync time="58.78"/>
everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, 
<Sync time="61.999"/>
and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, 
<Sync time="65.046"/>
had vanished completely.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="67.343" endTime="79.094">
<Sync time="67.343"/>
Very soon 
<Sync time="68.218"/>
the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an angry tone, 
<Sync time="71.765"/>
"Why, Mary Ann, 
<Sync time="72.749"/>
what are you doing out here? 
<Sync time="74.031"/>
Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! 
<Sync time="77.156"/>
Quick, now!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="79.094" endTime="104.75">
<Sync time="79.094"/>
"He took me for his housemaid!" said Alice, 
<Sync time="81.328"/>
as she ran off. 
<Sync time="82.577"/>
"How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!" 
<Sync time="85.906"/>
As she said this, 
<Sync time="87.062"/>
she came upon a neat little house, 
<Sync time="88.922"/>
on the door of which 
<Sync time="90.063"/>
was a bright brass plate with the name 
<Sync time="92.22"/>
"W. RABBIT" engraved upon it. 
<Sync time="94.518"/>
She went in without knocking 
<Sync time="96.018"/>
and hurried upstairs, 
<Sync time="97.33"/>
in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann 
<Sync time="100.282"/>
and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="104.75" endTime="133.001">
<Sync time="104.75"/>
By this time, 
<Sync time="105.907"/>
Alice had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, 
<Sync time="109.751"/>
and on it 
<Sync time="110.547"/>
a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves; 
<Sync time="114.25"/>
she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves 
<Sync time="116.969"/>
and was just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. 
<Sync time="122.719"/>
She uncorked it and put it to her lips, 
<Sync time="125.438"/>
saying to herself, 
<Sync time="126.829"/>
"I do hope it'll make me grow large again, 
<Sync time="128.861"/>
for, really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="133.001" endTime="146.503">
<Sync time="133.001"/>
Before she had drunk half the bottle, 
<Sync time="135.267"/>
she found her head pressing against the ceiling, 
<Sync time="137.736"/>
and had to stoop to save her neck 
<Sync time="139.534"/>
from being broken. 
<Sync time="140.815"/>
She hastily put down the bottle, remarking, 
<Sync time="143.346"/>
"That's quite enough—I hope I sha'n't grow any more."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="146.503" endTime="166.289">
<Sync time="146.503"/>
Alas! 
<Sync time="147.362"/>
It was too late to wish that! 
<Sync time="149.253"/>
She went on growing and growing and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor. 
<Sync time="153.847"/>
Still she went on growing, 
<Sync time="155.675"/>
and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window 
<Sync time="158.738"/>
and one foot up the chimney, 
<Sync time="160.473"/>
and said to herself, 
<Sync time="161.942"/>
"Now I can do no more, whatever happens. 
<Sync time="164.52"/>
What will become of me?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="166.289" endTime="167.207">
<Sync time="166.289"/>
i012_th.jpg
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="167.207" endTime="177.02">
<Sync time="167.207"/>
Luckily for Alice, 
<Sync time="168.614"/>
the little magic bottle had now had its full effect 
<Sync time="171.567"/>
and she grew no larger. 
<Sync time="173.442"/>
After a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="177.02" endTime="196.989">
<Sync time="177.02"/>
"Mary Ann! 
<Sync time="177.988"/>
Mary Ann!" said the voice. 
<Sync time="179.723"/>
"Fetch me my gloves this moment!" 
<Sync time="181.973"/>
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. 
<Sync time="185.129"/>
Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her 
<Sync time="187.613"/>
and she trembled till she shook the house, 
<Sync time="190.191"/>
quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit 
<Sync time="194.005"/>
and had no reason to be afraid of it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="196.989" endTime="212.598">
<Sync time="196.989"/>
Presently 
<Sync time="197.879"/>
the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; 
<Sync time="200.661"/>
but as the door opened inwards and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, 
<Sync time="205.051"/>
that attempt proved a failure. 
<Sync time="207.864"/>
Alice heard it say to itself, 
<Sync time="209.895"/>
"Then I'll go 'round and get in at the window."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="212.598" endTime="233.96">
<Sync time="212.598"/>
"That you won't!" 
<Sync time="213.817"/>
thought Alice; 
<Sync time="214.911"/>
and after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, 
<Sync time="218.708"/>
she suddenly spread out her hand 
<Sync time="220.317"/>
and made a snatch in the air. 
<Sync time="222.254"/>
She did not get hold of anything, 
<Sync time="224.16"/>
but she heard a little shriek 
<Sync time="225.676"/>
and a fall 
<Sync time="226.537"/>
and a crash of broken glass, 
<Sync time="228.475"/>
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="233.96" endTime="244.974">
<Sync time="233.96"/>
Next came an angry voice—
<Sync time="235.835"/>
the Rabbit's—
<Sync time="236.85"/>
"Pat!
<Sync time="237.506"/>
 Pat! Where are you?" 
<Sync time="239.194"/>
And then a voice she had never heard before, 
<Sync time="241.412"/>
"Sure then, I'm here! 
<Sync time="242.834"/>
Digging for apples, yer honor!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="244.974" endTime="249.129">
<Sync time="244.974"/>
"Here! Come and help me out of this! 
<Sync time="246.942"/>
Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="249.129" endTime="251.379">
<Sync time="249.129"/>
"Sure, it's an arm, yer honor!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="251.379" endTime="255.738">
<Sync time="251.379"/>
"Well, it's got no business there, at any rate; 
<Sync time="253.504"/>
go and take it away!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="255.738" endTime="275.567">
<Sync time="255.738"/>
There was a long silence after this 
<Sync time="257.8"/>
and Alice could only hear whispers now and then, 
<Sync time="260.347"/>
and at last she spread out her hand again 
<Sync time="262.628"/>
and made another snatch in the air. 
<Sync time="264.395"/>
This time there were two little shrieks 
<Sync time="266.457"/>
and more sounds of broken glass. 
<Sync time="268.77"/>
"I wonder what they'll do next!" thought Alice. 
<Sync time="271.426"/>
"As for pulling me out of the window, 
<Sync time="273.176"/>
I only wish they could!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="275.567" endTime="298.721">
<Sync time="275.567"/>
She waited for some time without hearing anything more. 
<Sync time="278.988"/>
At last 
<Sync time="280.081"/>
came a rumbling of little cart-wheels 
<Sync time="281.94"/>
and the sound of a good many voices 
<Sync time="283.689"/>
all talking together. 
<Sync time="285.175"/>
She made out the words: 
<Sync time="286.487"/>
"Where's the other ladder? 
<Sync time="287.894"/>
Bill's got the other—
<Sync time="288.862"/>
Bill! 
<Sync time="289.565"/>
Here, Bill! 
<Sync time="290.362"/>
Will the roof bear?—
<Sync time="291.487"/>
Who's to go down the chimney?—
<Sync time="292.799"/>
Nay, I sha'n't! You do it! 
<Sync time="294.439"/>
Here, Bill! 
<Sync time="295.486"/>
The master says you've got to go down the chimney!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="298.721" endTime="311.582">
<Sync time="298.721"/>
Alice drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could 
<Sync time="301.535"/>
and waited till she heard a little animal scratching 
<Sync time="304.111"/>
and scrambling about in the chimney close above her; 
<Sync time="307.002"/>
then she gave one sharp kick 
<Sync time="308.879"/>
and waited to see what would happen next.
</Turn>
<Turn startTime="311.582" endTime="325.425" speaker="spk1">
<Sync time="311.582"/>
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 
<Sync time="314.191"/>
"There goes Bill!" 
<Sync time="315.425"/>
then the Rabbit's voice alone—
<Sync time="317.065"/>
"Catch him, 
<Sync time="317.613"/>
you by the hedge!" 
<Sync time="318.754"/>
Then silence 
<Sync time="319.753"/>
and then another confusion of voices—
<Sync time="321.41"/>
"Hold up his head—
<Sync time="322.425"/>
Brandy now—Don't choke him—
<Sync time="323.8"/>
What happened to you?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="325.425" endTime="338.442">
<Sync time="325.425"/>
Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, 
<Sync time="328.801"/>
"Well, I hardly know—
<Sync time="330.176"/>
No more, thank ye. I'm better now—
<Sync time="331.785"/>
all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="338.442" endTime="347.035">
<Sync time="338.442"/>
After a minute or two of silence, 
<Sync time="340.286"/>
they began moving about again, 
<Sync time="341.817"/>
and Alice heard the Rabbit say, 
<Sync time="344.082"/>
"A barrowful will do, 
<Sync time="345.254"/>
to begin with."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="347.035" endTime="370.974">
<Sync time="347.035"/>
"A barrowful of what?" 
<Sync time="348.66"/>
thought Alice. 
<Sync time="349.989"/>
But she had not long to doubt, 
<Sync time="351.521"/>
for the next moment a shower of little 
<Sync time="353.615"/>
pebbles came rattling in at the window 
<Sync time="355.848"/>
and some of them hit her in the face. 
<Sync time="357.817"/>
Alice noticed, 
<Sync time="358.755"/>
with some surprise, 
<Sync time="359.88"/>
that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor 
<Sync time="363.442"/>
and a bright idea came into her head. 
<Sync time="366.27"/>
"If I eat one of these cakes," she thought, 
<Sync time="368.114"/>
"it's sure to make some change in my size."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="370.974" endTime="391.664">
<Sync time="370.974"/>
So she swallowed one of the cakes 
<Sync time="372.786"/>
and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. 
<Sync time="376.192"/>
As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, 
<Sync time="378.691"/>
she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. 
<Sync time="383.878"/>
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared, 
<Sync time="386.723"/>
but she ran off as hard as she could 
<Sync time="388.77"/>
and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="391.664" endTime="392.488">
<Sync time="391.664"/>
plate03_th.jpg
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="392.488" endTime="408.004">
<Sync time="392.488"/>
"The first thing I've got to do," said Alice to herself, 
<Sync time="395.316"/>
as she wandered about in the wood, 
<Sync time="397.113"/>
"is to grow to my right size again; 
<Sync time="399.332"/>
and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. 
<Sync time="402.613"/>
I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other, but 
<Sync time="405.395"/>
the great question is 'What?'"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="408.004" endTime="438.946">
<Sync time="408.004"/>
Alice looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, 
<Sync time="411.707"/>
but she could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. 
<Sync time="416.52"/>
There was a large mushroom growing near her, 
<Sync time="418.879"/>
about the same height as herself. 
<Sync time="420.785"/>
She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge 
<Sync time="423.91"/>
and her eyes immediately met those 
<Sync time="426.223"/>
of a large 
<Sync time="427.129"/>
blue 
<Sync time="427.613"/>
caterpillar, 
<Sync time="428.614"/>
that was sitting on the top, 
<Sync time="430.222"/>
with its arms folded, 
<Sync time="431.91"/>
quietly smoking a long hookah 
<Sync time="434.018"/>
and taking 
<Sync time="434.83"/>
not the smallest notice 
<Sync time="436.314"/>
of her 
<Sync time="437.11"/>
or of anything else.
