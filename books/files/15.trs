PIG AND PEPPER
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="25.031" endTime="42.205">
<Sync time="25.031"/>
For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, 
<Sync time="27.718"/>
when suddenly 
<Sync time="28.593"/>
a footman in livery came running out of the wood 
<Sync time="31.124"/>
(judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)—
<Sync time="34.17"/>
and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. 
<Sync time="36.701"/>
It was opened by another footman in livery, 
<Sync time="39.31"/>
with a round face and large eyes like a frog.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="42.205" endTime="42.919">

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="42.919" endTime="70.075">
<Sync time="42.919"/>
The Fish-Footman began by producing 
<Sync time="45.138"/>
from under his arm 
<Sync time="46.216"/>
a great letter, 
<Sync time="47.325"/>
and this he handed over to the other, 
<Sync time="48.903"/>
saying, 
<Sync time="49.652"/>
in a solemn tone, 
<Sync time="51.199"/>
"For the Duchess. 
<Sync time="52.574"/>
An invitation from the Queen 
<Sync time="54.434"/>
to play croquet." 
<Sync time="56.668"/>
The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, 
<Sync time="59.95"/>
"From the Queen. 
<Sync time="61.012"/>
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet." 
<Sync time="64.778"/>
Then they both bowed low 
<Sync time="66.653"/>
and their curls got entangled together.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="70.075" endTime="82.777">
<Sync time="70.075"/>
When Alice next peeped out, 
<Sync time="72.012"/>
the Fish-Footman was gone, 
<Sync time="73.637"/>
and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky. 
<Sync time="78.777"/>
Alice went timidly up to the door 
<Sync time="80.761"/>
and knocked.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="82.777" endTime="107.557">
<Sync time="82.777"/>
"There's no sort of use in knocking," said the Footman, 
<Sync time="85.668"/>
"and that for two reasons. 
<Sync time="87.324"/>
First, 
<Sync time="88.043"/>
because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; 
<Sync time="90.277"/>
secondly, 
<Sync time="91.245"/>
because they're making such a noise inside, 
<Sync time="93.292"/>
no one could possibly hear you." 
<Sync time="95.401"/>
And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within—
<Sync time="99.573"/>
a constant howling and sneezing, 
<Sync time="101.854"/>
and every now and then a great crash, 
<Sync time="103.979"/>
as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="107.557" endTime="110.431">
<Sync time="107.557"/>
"How am I to get in?" 
<Sync time="108.822"/>
asked Alice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="110.431" endTime="115.088">
<Sync time="110.431"/>
"Are you to get in at all?" said the Footman. 
<Sync time="112.322"/>
"That's the first question, you know."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="115.088" endTime="133.526">
<Sync time="115.088"/>
Alice opened the door and went in. 
<Sync time="118.041"/>
The door led right into a large kitchen, 
<Sync time="120.4"/>
which was full of smoke from one end to the other; 
<Sync time="123.135"/>
the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; 
<Sync time="127.588"/>
the cook was leaning over the fire, 
<Sync time="129.432"/>
stirring a large caldron which seemed to be full of soup.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="133.526" endTime="154.306">
<Sync time="133.526"/>
"There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!" 
<Sync time="135.87"/>
Alice said to herself, 
<Sync time="137.182"/>
as well as she could for sneezing. 
<Sync time="139.088"/>
Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; 
<Sync time="141.244"/>
and as for the baby, 
<Sync time="142.526"/>
it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. 
<Sync time="146.276"/>
The only two creatures in the kitchen that did not sneeze 
<Sync time="149.198"/>
were the cook 
<Sync time="150.026"/>
and a large cat, 
<Sync time="151.416"/>
which was grinning from ear to ear.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="154.306" endTime="159.618">
<Sync time="154.306"/>
"Please would you tell me," said Alice, a little timidly, 
<Sync time="157.274"/>
"why your cat grins like that?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="159.618" endTime="163.572">
<Sync time="159.618"/>
"It's a Cheshire-Cat," said the Duchess, 
<Sync time="161.478"/>
"and that's why."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="163.572" endTime="169.891">
<Sync time="163.572"/>
"I didn't know that Cheshire-Cats always grinned; 
<Sync time="166.205"/>
in fact, I didn't know that cats could grin," 
<Sync time="168.501"/>
said Alice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="169.891" endTime="173.453">
<Sync time="169.891"/>
"You don't know much," said the Duchess, "and that's a fact."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="173.453" endTime="194.593">
<Sync time="173.453"/>
Just then the cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, 
<Sync time="176.562"/>
and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—
<Sync time="181.171"/>
the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates and dishes. 
<Sync time="186.218"/>
The Duchess took no notice of them, even when they hit her, 
<Sync time="188.922"/>
and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="194.593" endTime="200.343">
<Sync time="194.593"/>
"Oh, please 
<Sync time="195.421"/>
mind what you're doing!" cried Alice, 
<Sync time="197.343"/>
jumping up and down in an agony of terror.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="200.343" endTime="212.125">
<Sync time="200.343"/>
"Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!" 
<Sync time="202.766"/>
the Duchess said to Alice, 
<Sync time="204.156"/>
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. 
<Sync time="206.5"/>
"I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen," 
<Sync time="209.547"/>
and she hurried out of the room.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="212.125" endTime="232.359">
<Sync time="212.125"/>
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, 
<Sync time="214.516"/>
as it was a queer-shaped little creature 
<Sync time="216.641"/>
and held out its arms and legs in all directions. 
<Sync time="220.094"/>
"If I don't take this child away with me," thought Alice, 
<Sync time="222.75"/>
"they're sure to kill it in a day or two. 
<Sync time="224.969"/>
Wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?" 
<Sync time="227.375"/>
She said the last words out loud 
<Sync time="229.532"/>
and the little thing grunted in reply.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="232.359" endTime="238.563">
<Sync time="232.359"/>
"If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear," said Alice, 
<Sync time="235.046"/>
"I'll have nothing more to do with you. 
<Sync time="236.64"/>
Mind now!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="238.563" endTime="262.656">
<Sync time="238.563"/>
Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 
<Sync time="241.25"/>
"Now, what am I to do with this creature, when I get it home?" 
<Sync time="244.047"/>
when it grunted again so violently 
<Sync time="246.203"/>
that Alice looked down into its face in some alarm. 
<Sync time="249.453"/>
This time there could be no mistake about it—
<Sync time="252.406"/>
it was neither more nor less 
<Sync time="254.313"/>
than a pig; 
<Sync time="255.484"/>
so she set the little creature down 
<Sync time="257.531"/>
and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="262.656" endTime="279.124">
<Sync time="262.656"/>
Alice was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire-Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. 
<Sync time="268.328"/>
The Cat only grinned when it saw her. 
<Sync time="271.093"/>
"Cheshire-Puss," 
<Sync time="272.484"/>
began Alice, rather timidly, 
<Sync time="274.953"/>
"would you please tell me 
<Sync time="276.39"/>
which way I ought to go from here?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="279.124" endTime="292.483">
<Sync time="279.124"/>
"In that direction," 
<Sync time="280.858"/>
the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, 
<Sync time="283.154"/>
"lives a Hatter; 
<Sync time="284.467"/>
and in that direction," 
<Sync time="286.139"/>
waving the other paw, 
<Sync time="287.577"/>
"lives a March Hare. 
<Sync time="289.389"/>
Visit either you like; they're both mad."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="292.483" endTime="296.451">
<Sync time="292.483"/>
"But I don't want to go among mad people," 
<Sync time="294.811"/>
Alice remarked.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="296.451" endTime="303.202">
<Sync time="296.451"/>
"Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat; 
<Sync time="298.592"/>
"we're all mad here. 
<Sync time="300.311"/>
Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="303.202" endTime="307.858">
<Sync time="303.202"/>
"I should like it very much," said Alice, 
<Sync time="305.327"/>
"but I haven't been invited yet."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="307.858" endTime="312.123">
<Sync time="307.858"/>
"You'll see me there," 
<Sync time="309.077"/>
said the Cat, 
<Sync time="310.03"/>
and vanished.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="312.123" endTime="330.684">
<Sync time="312.123"/>
Alice had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare; 
<Sync time="316.64"/>
it was so large a house 
<Sync time="318.172"/>
that she did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom.
<Sync time="323.0"/>
