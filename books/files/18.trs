WHO STOLE THE TARTS?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="26.281" endTime="59.015">
<Sync time="26.281"/>
The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, 
<Sync time="29.983"/>
with a great crowd assembled about them—
<Sync time="32.671"/>
all sorts of little birds and beasts, 
<Sync time="35.078"/>
as well as the whole pack of cards: 
<Sync time="37.374"/>
the Knave was standing before them, in chains, 
<Sync time="40.108"/>
with a soldier on each side to guard him; 
<Sync time="42.514"/>
and near the King 
<Sync time="43.483"/>
was the White Rabbit, 
<Sync time="44.608"/>
with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other. 
<Sync time="48.514"/>
In the very middle of the court was a table, 
<Sync time="50.78"/>
with a large dish of tarts upon it. 
<Sync time="53.483"/>
"I wish they'd get the trial done," 
<Sync time="55.202"/>
Alice thought, 
<Sync time="56.248"/>
"and hand 'round the refreshments!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="59.015" endTime="72.75">
<Sync time="59.015"/>
The judge, by the way, 
<Sync time="60.531"/>
was the King 
<Sync time="61.436"/>
and he wore his crown over his great wig. 
<Sync time="64.483"/>
"That's the jury-box," thought Alice; 
<Sync time="66.718"/>
"and those twelve creatures 
<Sync time="68.25"/>
(some were animals and some were birds) 
<Sync time="70.468"/>
I suppose they are the jurors."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="72.75" endTime="73.25">
<Sync time="72.75"/>

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="73.25" endTime="77.251">
<Sync time="73.25"/>
Just then the White Rabbit cried out 
<Sync time="75.204"/>
"Silence in the court!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="77.251" endTime="80.751">
<Sync time="77.251"/>
"Herald, 
<Sync time="78.032"/>
read the accusation!" said the King.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="80.751" endTime="87.766">
<Sync time="80.751"/>
On this, 
<Sync time="81.626"/>
the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, 
<Sync time="84.36"/>
then unrolled the parchment-scroll and read as follows:
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="87.766" endTime="96.924">
<Sync time="87.766"/>
"The Queen of Hearts, 
<Sync time="88.907"/>
she made some tarts,
<Sync time="90.219"/>
All on a summer day;
<Sync time="92.032"/>
The Knave of Hearts, 
<Sync time="93.173"/>
he stole those tarts
<Sync time="94.502"/>
And took them quite away!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="96.924" endTime="104.455">
<Sync time="96.924"/>
"Call the first witness," said the King; 
<Sync time="98.877"/>
and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out, 
<Sync time="102.268"/>
"First witness!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="104.455" endTime="111.502">
<Sync time="104.455"/>
The first witness was the Hatter. 
<Sync time="106.518"/>
He came in with a teacup in one hand 
<Sync time="108.674"/>
and a piece of bread and butter in the other.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="111.502" endTime="115.564">
<Sync time="111.502"/>
"You ought to have finished," said the King. 
<Sync time="113.533"/>
"When did you begin?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="115.564" endTime="124.986">
<Sync time="115.564"/>
The Hatter looked at the March Hare, 
<Sync time="117.361"/>
who had followed him into the court, 
<Sync time="119.111"/>
arm in arm with the Dormouse. 
<Sync time="121.532"/>
"Fourteenth of March, I think it was," 
<Sync time="123.548"/>
he said.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="124.986" endTime="129.892">
<Sync time="124.986"/>
"Give your evidence," said the King, 
<Sync time="126.486"/>
"and don't be nervous, or I'll have you 
<Sync time="128.064"/>
executed on the spot."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="129.892" endTime="142.507">
<Sync time="129.892"/>
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; 
<Sync time="132.705"/>
he kept shifting from one foot to the other, 
<Sync time="135.095"/>
looking uneasily at the Queen, 
<Sync time="137.049"/>
and, in his confusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup 
<Sync time="140.429"/>
instead of the bread and butter.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="142.507" endTime="150.193">
<Sync time="142.507"/>
Just at this moment Alice felt a very 
<Sync time="144.694"/>
curious sensation—
<Sync time="146.787"/>
she was beginning to grow larger again.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="150.193" endTime="157.818">
<Sync time="150.193"/>
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went down on one knee. 
<Sync time="154.881"/>
"I'm a poor man, Your Majesty," he began.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="157.818" endTime="161.069">
<Sync time="157.818"/>
"You're a very poor speaker," 
<Sync time="159.569"/>
said the King.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="161.069" endTime="165.288">
<Sync time="161.069"/>
"You may go," said the King, 
<Sync time="162.679"/>
and the Hatter hurriedly left the court.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="165.288" endTime="168.273">
<Sync time="165.288"/>
"Call the next witness!" said the King.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="168.273" endTime="176.585">
<Sync time="168.273"/>
The next witness was the Duchess's cook. 
<Sync time="170.866"/>
She carried the pepper-box in her hand 
<Sync time="172.866"/>
and the people near the door began sneezing 
<Sync time="175.038"/>
all at once.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="176.585" endTime="178.616">
<Sync time="176.585"/>
"Give your evidence," said the King.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="178.616" endTime="181.162">
<Sync time="178.616"/>
"Sha'n't," 
<Sync time="179.366"/>
said the cook.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="181.162" endTime="189.209">
<Sync time="181.162"/>
The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, 
<Sync time="184.052"/>
in a low voice, 
<Sync time="185.49"/>
"Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="189.209" endTime="193.991">
<Sync time="189.209"/>
"Well, if I must, I must," the King said. 
<Sync time="191.897"/>
"What are tarts made of?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="193.991" endTime="196.288">
<Sync time="193.991"/>
"Pepper, mostly," said the cook.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="196.288" endTime="203.164">
<Sync time="196.288"/>
For some minutes the whole court was in confusion 
<Sync time="199.273"/>
and by the time they had settled down again, 
<Sync time="201.258"/>
the cook had disappeared.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="203.164" endTime="206.805">
<Sync time="203.164"/>
"Never mind!" said the King, 
<Sync time="204.617"/>
"call the next witness."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="206.805" endTime="224.758">
<Sync time="206.805"/>
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. 
<Sync time="209.961"/>
Imagine her surprise when he read out, 
<Sync time="212.399"/>
at the top of his shrill little voice, 
<Sync time="214.478"/>
the name 
<Sync time="215.493"/>
"Alice!"
<Sync time="217.509"/>
