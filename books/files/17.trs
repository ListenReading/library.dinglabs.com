THE QUEEN'S CROQUET GROUND
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="27.653" endTime="49.355">
<Sync time="27.653"/>
A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden; 
<Sync time="31.044"/>
the roses growing on it were white, 
<Sync time="33.2"/>
but there were three gardeners at it, 
<Sync time="35.184"/>
busily painting them red. 
<Sync time="37.309"/>
Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, 
<Sync time="40.715"/>
as she stood watching them. 
<Sync time="42.887"/>
"Would you tell me, please," 
<Sync time="44.199"/>
said Alice, a little timidly, 
<Sync time="46.215"/>
"why you are painting those roses?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="49.355" endTime="86.823">
<Sync time="49.355"/>
Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. 
<Sync time="52.184"/>
Two began, in a low voice, 
<Sync time="54.558"/>
"Why, the fact is, you see, 
<Sync time="56.104"/>
Miss, 
<Sync time="56.885"/>
this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, 
<Sync time="59.338"/>
and we put a white one in by mistake; 
<Sync time="61.447"/>
and, if the Queen was to find it out, 
<Sync time="63.541"/>
we should all have our heads cut off, you know. 
<Sync time="66.416"/>
So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to—" 
<Sync time="70.307"/>
At this moment, Five, 
<Sync time="72.01"/>
who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out, 
<Sync time="74.823"/>
"The Queen! The Queen!" 
<Sync time="76.323"/>
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. 
<Sync time="80.542"/>
There was a sound of many footsteps 
<Sync time="82.87"/>
and Alice looked 'round, 
<Sync time="84.511"/>
eager to see the Queen.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="86.823" endTime="120.151">
<Sync time="86.823"/>
First 
<Sync time="87.651"/>
came ten soldiers carrying clubs, 
<Sync time="89.635"/>
with their hands and feet at the corners: 
<Sync time="92.135"/>
next 
<Sync time="92.978"/>
the ten courtiers; 
<Sync time="94.167"/>
these were ornamented all over with diamonds. 
<Sync time="96.714"/>
After these came the royal children; 
<Sync time="98.964"/>
there were ten of them, 
<Sync time="100.011"/>
all ornamented with hearts. 
<Sync time="101.73"/>
Next came the guests, 
<Sync time="103.308"/>
mostly Kings and Queens, 
<Sync time="104.98"/>
and among them Alice recognized 
<Sync time="107.042"/>
the White Rabbit. 
<Sync time="108.792"/>
Then followed the Knave of Hearts, 
<Sync time="110.885"/>
carrying the King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; 
<Sync time="113.948"/>
and last of all this grand procession 
<Sync time="116.182"/>
came THE KING AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="120.151" endTime="134.009">
<Sync time="120.151"/>
When the procession came opposite to Alice, 
<Sync time="122.51"/>
they all stopped 
<Sync time="123.744"/>
and looked at her, 
<Sync time="124.822"/>
and the Queen said severely, 
<Sync time="126.603"/>
"Who is this?" 
<Sync time="128.619"/>
She said it to the Knave of Hearts, 
<Sync time="130.65"/>
who only bowed and smiled in reply.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="134.009" endTime="144.415">
<Sync time="134.009"/>
"My name is Alice, 
<Sync time="135.415"/>
so please Your Majesty," 
<Sync time="136.931"/>
said Alice very politely; 
<Sync time="138.634"/>
but she added to herself, 
<Sync time="140.337"/>
"Why, 
<Sync time="141.04"/>
they're only a pack of cards, after all!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="144.415" endTime="151.305">
<Sync time="144.415"/>
"Can you play croquet?" 
<Sync time="146.337"/>
shouted the Queen. 
<Sync time="148.305"/>
The question was evidently meant for Alice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="151.305" endTime="153.868">
<Sync time="151.305"/>
"Yes!" 
<Sync time="152.102"/>
said Alice loudly.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="153.868" endTime="156.618">
<Sync time="153.868"/>
"Come on, then!" 
<Sync time="155.149"/>
roared the Queen.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="156.618" endTime="166.946">
<Sync time="156.618"/>
"It's—
<Sync time="157.774"/>
it's a very fine day!" 
<Sync time="159.274"/>
said a timid voice to Alice. 
<Sync time="161.633"/>
She was walking by the White Rabbit, 
<Sync time="163.852"/>
who was peeping anxiously into her face.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="166.946" endTime="170.024">
<Sync time="166.946"/>
"Very," said Alice. 
<Sync time="168.555"/>
"Where's the Duchess?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="170.024" endTime="174.508">
<Sync time="170.024"/>
"Hush! Hush!" said the Rabbit. 
<Sync time="171.586"/>
"She's under sentence of execution."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="174.508" endTime="176.758">
<Sync time="174.508"/>
"What for?" said Alice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="176.758" endTime="180.18">
<Sync time="176.758"/>
"She boxed the Queen's ears—" the Rabbit began.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="180.18" endTime="194.445">
<Sync time="180.18"/>
"Get to your places!" 
<Sync time="181.399"/>
shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, 
<Sync time="183.524"/>
and people began running about in all directions, 
<Sync time="186.493"/>
tumbling up against each other. 
<Sync time="188.571"/>
However, 
<Sync time="189.383"/>
they got settled down in a minute or two, 
<Sync time="191.867"/>
and the game began.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="194.445" endTime="213.617">
<Sync time="194.445"/>
Alice thought she had never seen 
<Sync time="196.726"/>
such a curious croquet-ground 
<Sync time="198.976"/>
in her life; 
<Sync time="200.789"/>
it was all ridges and furrows. 
<Sync time="202.866"/>
The croquet balls 
<Sync time="204.131"/>
were live hedgehogs, 
<Sync time="205.788"/>
and the mallets 
<Sync time="206.789"/>
live flamingos 
<Sync time="208.07"/>
and the soldiers had to double themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, 
<Sync time="211.742"/>
to make the arches.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="213.617" endTime="229.947">
<Sync time="213.617"/>
The players all played at once, 
<Sync time="215.211"/>
without waiting for turns, 
<Sync time="216.742"/>
quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; 
<Sync time="219.821"/>
and in a very short time, 
<Sync time="221.227"/>
the Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting, 
<Sync time="224.837"/>
"Off with his head!" 
<Sync time="225.821"/>
or 
<Sync time="226.259"/>
"Off with her head!" 
<Sync time="227.494"/>
about once in a minute.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="229.947" endTime="236.869">
<Sync time="229.947"/>
"They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here," thought Alice; 
<Sync time="233.212"/>
"the great wonder is that there's anyone left alive!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="236.869" endTime="249.088">
<Sync time="236.869"/>
She was looking about for some way of escape, 
<Sync time="239.604"/>
when she noticed a curious appearance in the air. 
<Sync time="242.979"/>
"It's the Cheshire-Cat," she said to herself; 
<Sync time="245.526"/>
"now I shall have somebody to talk to."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="249.088" endTime="251.776">
<Sync time="249.088"/>
"How are you getting on?" said the Cat.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="251.776" endTime="263.792">
<Sync time="251.776"/>
"I don't think they play at all fairly," 
<Sync time="253.854"/>
Alice said, in a rather complaining tone; 
<Sync time="256.401"/>
"and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak—
<Sync time="259.995"/>
and they don't seem to have any rules in particular."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="263.792" endTime="267.698">
<Sync time="263.792"/>
"How do you like the Queen?" said the Cat 
<Sync time="265.714"/>
in a low voice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="267.698" endTime="269.981">
<Sync time="267.698"/>
"Not at all," said Alice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="269.981" endTime="270.838">
<Sync time="269.981"/>

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="270.838" endTime="300.588">
<Sync time="270.838"/>
Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on. 
<Sync time="274.447"/>
So she went off in search of her hedgehog. 
<Sync time="277.072"/>
The hedgehog 
<Sync time="278.01"/>
was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, 
<Sync time="280.541"/>
which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other; 
<Sync time="285.151"/>
the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, 
<Sync time="289.651"/>
where Alice could see it trying, 
<Sync time="291.197"/>
in a helpless sort of way, 
<Sync time="292.557"/>
to fly up into a tree. 
<Sync time="295.198"/>
She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under her arm, 
<Sync time="298.01"/>
that it might not escape again.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="300.588" endTime="322.9">
<Sync time="300.588"/>
Just then 
<Sync time="301.417"/>
Alice ran across the Duchess 
<Sync time="303.151"/>
(who was now out of prison). 
<Sync time="305.432"/>
She tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's and they walked off together. 
<Sync time="309.166"/>
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper. 
<Sync time="312.557"/>
She was a little startled, however, 
<Sync time="314.4"/>
when she heard the voice of the Duchess 
<Sync time="316.181"/>
close to her ear. 
<Sync time="317.963"/>
"You're thinking about something, my dear, 
<Sync time="319.869"/>
and that makes you forget to talk."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="322.9" endTime="328.306">
<Sync time="322.9"/>
"The game's going on rather better now," 
<Sync time="324.697"/>
Alice said, 
<Sync time="325.697"/>
by way of keeping up the conversation a little.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="328.306" endTime="336.134">
<Sync time="328.306"/>
"'Tis so," said the Duchess; 
<Sync time="329.915"/>
"and the moral of that is—
<Sync time="331.618"/>
'Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love that makes the world go 'round!'"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="336.134" endTime="342.086">
<Sync time="336.134"/>
"Somebody said," 
<Sync time="337.352"/>
Alice whispered, 
<Sync time="338.478"/>
"that it's done by everybody minding his own business!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="342.086" endTime="355.101">
<Sync time="342.086"/>
"Ah, well! It means much the same thing," 
<Sync time="344.023"/>
said the Duchess, 
<Sync time="345.179"/>
digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder, as she added 
<Sync time="348.804"/>
"and the moral of that is—
<Sync time="350.429"/>
'Take care of the sense 
<Sync time="351.71"/>
and the sounds will take care of themselves.'"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="355.101" endTime="368.821">
<Sync time="355.101"/>
To Alice's great surprise, 
<Sync time="357.023"/>
the Duchess's arm that was linked into hers 
<Sync time="359.462"/>
began to tremble. 
<Sync time="361.415"/>
Alice looked up 
<Sync time="362.587"/>
and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, 
<Sync time="366.056"/>
frowning like a thunderstorm!
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="368.821" endTime="385.93">
<Sync time="368.821"/>
"Now, I give you fair warning," shouted the Queen, 
<Sync time="371.462"/>
stamping on the ground as she spoke, 
<Sync time="373.493"/>
"either you or your head must be off, 
<Sync time="377.18"/>
and that in about half no time. 
<Sync time="379.821"/>
Take your choice!" 
<Sync time="381.915"/>
The Duchess took her choice, 
<Sync time="383.633"/>
and was gone in a moment.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="385.93" endTime="396.204">
<Sync time="385.93"/>
"Let's go on with the game," 
<Sync time="387.57"/>
the Queen said to Alice; 
<Sync time="389.039"/>
and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, 
<Sync time="392.329"/>
but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="396.204" endTime="413.249">
<Sync time="396.204"/>
All the time they were playing, 
<Sync time="397.516"/>
the Queen never left off quarreling with the other players and shouting, 
<Sync time="400.781"/>
"Off with his head!" 
<Sync time="401.78"/>
or 
<Sync time="402.234"/>
"Off with her head!" 
<Sync time="403.937"/>
By the end of half an hour or so, 
<Sync time="405.936"/>
all the players, except the King, the Queen and Alice, 
<Sync time="408.733"/>
were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of execution.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="413.249" endTime="418.171">
<Sync time="413.249"/>
Then the Queen left off, 
<Sync time="414.703"/>
quite out of breath, 
<Sync time="416.015"/>
and walked away with Alice.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="418.171" endTime="425.031">
<Sync time="418.171"/>
Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally, 
<Sync time="422.219"/>
"You are all pardoned."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="425.031" endTime="440.790">
<Sync time="425.031"/>
Suddenly 
<Sync time="425.907"/>
the cry 
<Sync time="426.672"/>
"The Trial's beginning!" 
<Sync time="427.922"/>
was heard in the distance, 
<Sync time="429.61"/>
and Alice 
<Sync time="430.532"/>
ran along with the others.
<Sync time="432.422"/>
