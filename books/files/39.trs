EnglishLingQ, #4 Darcy Rezac, Managing Director of the Vancouver Board of Trade
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="0.286" endTime="16.062">
<Sync time="0.286"/>
I'm meeting this morning 
<Sync time="1.707"/>
with Darcy Rezac, 
<Sync time="3.313"/>
Managing Director of the Vancouver Board of Trade. 
<Sync time="6.403"/>
Now I know, Darcy, you have a particular interest, amongst your other duties, 
<Sync time="9.991"/>
in networking 
<Sync time="11.633"/>
and if I'm not mistaken you give a course on networking 
<Sync time="14.571"/>
here at the Board of Trade?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="16.062" endTime="19.943">
<Sync time="16.062"/>
I give a seminar to our new members 
<Sync time="18.446"/>
when they join.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="19.943" endTime="24.167">
<Sync time="19.943"/>
And is this something that all the new members 
<Sync time="22.98"/>
typically take part in?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="24.167" endTime="25.395">
<Sync time="24.167"/>
Yes.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="25.395" endTime="29.909">
<Sync time="25.395"/>
What are some of the things that you are able to 
<Sync time="27.381"/>
point out to them that 
<Sync time="28.633"/>
helps them in their networking?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="29.909" endTime="73.144">
<Sync time="29.909"/>
Well, networking is not something that comes naturally to people; 
<Sync time="32.407"/>
it's something that they have to learn to do. 
<Sync time="33.856"/>
And 
<Sync time="37.147"/>
most people feel uncomfortable with networking. 
<Sync time="40.112"/>
So, it's like riding a bike, 
<Sync time="41.666"/>
you've got to get over the fear 
<Sync time="43.752"/>
and just get on with it 
<Sync time="46.762"/>
and practice those habits. 
<Sync time="49.607"/>
You'll find that some people, diplomats for example, will learn the skills over a long period of time, some better than others. 
<Sync time="55.249"/>
People in the public affairs community 
<Sync time="58.286"/>
must have unusually good skills. 
<Sync time="60.977"/>
People in the media have to have good networking skills. 
<Sync time="63.721"/>
Networking is nothing more than communicating with people 
<Sync time="67.071"/>
in a way to make an impression, 
<Sync time="69.213"/>
preferably a positive impression.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="73.144" endTime="82.184">
<Sync time="73.144"/>
And I presume, 
<Sync time="75.701"/>
you feel this is a very important business skill and I guess the members of the Board of Trade feel the same way. 
<Sync time="80.35"/>
How it does it help people in their business?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="82.184" endTime="100.348">
<Sync time="82.184"/>
Well, most people 
<Sync time="84.426"/>
are involved in enterprises that require contacts with other people 
<Sync time="87.384"/>
or usually selling a product or service to other people 
<Sync time="89.486"/>
and to do so means they have to make contacts. 
<Sync time="92.74"/>
But even networking within an organization is terribly important 
<Sync time="95.644"/>
if people are to succeed and 
<Sync time="97.322"/>
go up 
<Sync time="98.644"/>
the ladder of success.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="100.348" endTime="110.825">
<Sync time="100.348"/>
I guess too, 
<Sync time="101.633"/>
particularly for people who might be newcomers to a society, 
<Sync time="105.137"/>
whether immigrants or people who moved in from elsewhere in Canada, 
<Sync time="108.693"/>
it's even more important to network.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="110.825" endTime="121.648">
<Sync time="110.825"/>
Very much so, 
<Sync time="112.793"/>
otherwise they'll be pigeon-holed 
<Sync time="116.065"/>
in various tasks and jobs that 
<Sync time="118.927"/>
won't allow them to achieve their full potential.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="121.648" endTime="127.84">
<Sync time="121.648"/>
Are there certain, sort of, attitudes, 
<Sync time="123.834"/>
certain mind-sets 
<Sync time="125.31"/>
that are important in networking?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="127.84" endTime="148.243">
<Sync time="127.84"/>
Absolutely. 
<Sync time="129.09"/>
Firstly, 
<Sync time="129.759"/>
they have to be available. 
<Sync time="130.927"/>
People have to go to things, 
<Sync time="132.588"/>
and go to a lot of things. 
<Sync time="133.993"/>
The other mindset is that their expectations must be realistic. 
<Sync time="137.804"/>
When they go to an event or function, 
<Sync time="139.991"/>
or someplace where they can network, 
<Sync time="142.294"/>
they ought not to expect that that's where they're going to make the sale if they're in sales, 
<Sync time="146.718"/>
but they're going to make a contact.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="148.243" endTime="153.32">
<Sync time="148.243"/>
Or for that matter where they're going to find a job, if they're looking for a job. 
<Sync time="151.654"/>
In other words, it's a long road.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="153.32" endTime="172.22">
<Sync time="153.32"/>
What you're really looking for is market intelligence; 
<Sync time="155.921"/>
market information 
<Sync time="157.529"/>
to allow you to achieve your goals. 
<Sync time="159.286"/>
Be it finding a job, 
<Sync time="160.354"/>
or finding an order, 
<Sync time="163.706"/>
or relocating, 
<Sync time="164.464"/>
whatever it might be. 
<Sync time="165.578"/>
You are looking for information. 
<Sync time="167.229"/>
And usually it's a long thread. 
<Sync time="168.907"/>
One contact leads to another, which leads to another.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="172.22" endTime="181.859">
<Sync time="172.22"/>
What are the opportunities that are available in a city like Vancouver? 
<Sync time="176.062"/>
Obviously the Board of Trade is the premium location for networking. 
<Sync time="179.369"/>
What are some other opportunities for networking?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="181.859" endTime="224.832">
<Sync time="181.859"/>
Church - go to church. 
<Sync time="184.242"/>
Get involved in volunteer activities. 
<Sync time="186.839"/>
Register with Volunteer Vancouver as a member. 
<Sync time="190.789"/>
Take a look at 
<Sync time="193.811"/>
all the organizations, events and societies in town that require volunteers. 
<Sync time="198.944"/>
Volunteer Vancouver is www.volunteervancouver.ca. 
<Sync time="203.828"/>
Everything from the DragonBoat Festival 
<Sync time="206.325"/>
to the Molson Indy to the Air Canada Open all require volunteers. 
<Sync time="211.35"/>
Invest the time and money,
<Sync time="213.460"/>
if you've got to buy a sweatshirt or jacket or whatever, do whatever you have to do, 
<Sync time="216.22"/>
get out and volunteer, 
<Sync time="218.547"/>
be it for the symphony or whatever it might be 
<Sync time="222.052"/>
to make contacts.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="224.832" endTime="231.556">
<Sync time="224.832"/>
Now, Volunteer Vancouver would steer you to all of these opportunities? 
<Sync time="228.898"/>
Is that like a one-stop shopping location?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="231.556" endTime="249.352">
<Sync time="231.556"/>
They maintain an inventory of 
<Sync time="235.101"/>
events and activities in town 
<Sync time="237.124"/>
and they refer volunteers to those activities. 
<Sync time="240.793"/>
They do all the volunteer staffing, for example, 
<Sync time="243.202"/>
for the DragonBoat Festival 
<Sync time="244.837"/>
and the Molson Indy has I think over 1,000 volunteers.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="249.352" endTime="255.952">
<Sync time="249.352"/>
And uh, 
<Sync time="250.214"/>
what about some of these breakfast clubs, 
<Sync time="252.042"/>
luncheon clubs, dinner clubs? 
<Sync time="253.671"/>
Are those good places to network?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="255.952" endTime="275.282">
<Sync time="255.952"/>
Excellent. 
<Sync time="258.894"/>
Vancouver AM is a good one. 
<Sync time="261.613"/>
Industry associations, 
<Sync time="263.23"/>
if someone's in the high-tech sector, for example, 
<Sync time="265.325"/>
the British Columbia Technology Industry Association 
<Sync time="270.989"/>
has events. 
<Sync time="271.773"/>
Go to those. 
<Sync time="272.676"/>
If you're in the tourism business, 
<Sync time="273.781"/>
Tourism Vancouver has events.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="275.282" endTime="280.84">
<Sync time="275.282"/>
Are these typically open to people who are not yet in the business 
<Sync time="278.569"/>
who would like to meet people to get into the business?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="280.84" endTime="290.367">
<Sync time="280.84"/>
Sure. 
<Sync time="281.345"/>
Some of them are. 
<Sync time="282.122"/>
Certainly Vancouver A.M. 
<Sync time="283.908"/>
has a sales and marketing focus. 
<Sync time="286.292"/>
It's kind of a breakfast club. 
<Sync time="287.76"/>
So, I mean, there are all sorts of things that you can do.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="290.367" endTime="295.625">
<Sync time="290.367"/>
And I guess some people go there in order to sell whatever services they have. 
<Sync time="293.832"/>
Other people go there to meet people.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="295.625" endTime="323.93">
<Sync time="295.625"/>
That's right, 
<Sync time="299.094"/>
certainly new immigrants are not only in downtown Vancouver. 
<Sync time="302.945"/>
But I'd recommend the first thing they do is go and join their local Chamber of Commerce. 
<Sync time="307.273"/>
Pay the dues, start going to meetings, 
<Sync time="308.88"/>
offer to volunteer for various events and activities. 
<Sync time="312.183"/>
That could be anything from 
<Sync time="314.11"/>
taking tickets at the door at an event 
<Sync time="317.567"/>
through to 
<Sync time="320.017"/>
participating in some policy work 
<Sync time="321.669"/>
or some other activities as time goes on.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="323.93" endTime="328.148">
<Sync time="323.93"/>
The Chambers of Commerce, 
<Sync time="325.655"/>
the local ones, are quite open to anyone really?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="328.148" endTime="333.337">
<Sync time="328.148"/>
Yes, 
<Sync time="329.139"/>
anyone can join 
<Sync time="330.985"/>
with an interest in business.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="333.337" endTime="346.355">
<Sync time="333.337"/>
Now how important is it to have an impressive name card? 
<Sync time="336.836"/>
Obviously, 
<Sync time="337.86"/>
someone who has immigrated here, 
<Sync time="339.256"/>
even though he might be a professional immigrant 
<Sync time="341.36"/>
but is working in a laundry, 
<Sync time="342.959"/>
he doesn't have a name card. 
<Sync time="344.717"/>
Does that inhibit him in any way?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="346.355" endTime="389.001">
<Sync time="346.355"/>
Well, you have to have a business card. 
<Sync time="353.025"/>
The business card should be easy to read, 
<Sync time="355.21"/>
it should have 
<Sync time="356.32"/>
your first name clearly 
<Sync time="358.801"/>
depicted on it. 
<Sync time="359.589"/>
Not just an initial, 
<Sync time="361.44"/>
but the name you want to be called by. 
<Sync time="362.833"/>
If it's a Korean or Asian name where it's juxtaposed, 
<Sync time="367.64"/>
I would recommend that you put it in the order in Canada that you want it pronounced 
<Sync time="372.975"/>
or underline the name that you want to be called by. 
<Sync time="379.074"/>
You want 
<Sync time="380.232"/>
e-mail address, 
<Sync time="381.365"/>
telephone number 
<Sync time="382.599"/>
and who you are. 
<Sync time="383.719"/>
If you have a profession, 
<Sync time="386.211"/>
if you're an accountant then you put that on it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="389.001" endTime="394.411">
<Sync time="389.001"/>
Even though, you might be working in a laundry at this time? Just put your profession on it? 
<Sync time="392.795"/>
Just your name and your profession?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="394.411" endTime="406.296">
<Sync time="394.411"/>
Absolutely. 
<Sync time="399.721"/>
People should be able to, from a name card, get some idea of what it is you're doing or what you want to do.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="406.296" endTime="412.017">
<Sync time="406.296"/>
Now what are the special 
<Sync time="408.455"/>
functions around networking 
<Sync time="409.874"/>
that take place here at the Board of Trade?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="412.017" endTime="473.348">
<Sync time="412.017"/>
Well, the Board of Trade puts on about 120 major events a year, 
<Sync time="414.798"/>
and about another 100 smaller events. 
<Sync time="417.153"/>
We have a member's reception once a month 
<Sync time="421.573"/>
where people come and it's a complimentary reception where 
<Sync time="424.617"/>
they meet 100 other people 
<Sync time="426.268"/>
and hand out their business cards and chat. 
<Sync time="428.116"/>
We start off with a networking 
<Sync time="430.667"/>
overview of the seminar 
<Sync time="432.069"/>
so that 
<Sync time="433.255"/>
people aren't shy when you hand out a card and hand it to people - it's what they expect. 
<Sync time="437.0"/>
At all our luncheons and events 
<Sync time="438.368"/>
we have major speakers 
<Sync time="439.572"/>
everywhere from Corazon Aquino 
<Sync time="441.253"/>
to Lee Quan Yu, 
<Sync time="442.257"/>
Prince Philip has spoken here, 
<Sync time="443.86"/>
to business CEO's, 
<Sync time="444.968"/>
bank presidents and so on. 
<Sync time="446.741"/>
We've had Gerry Adams speak here 
<Sync time="449.477"/>
and we had Lauren Lombard speak last week. 
<Sync time="452.373"/>
We've had some controversial figures speak here. 
<Sync time="454.286"/>
Even Jane Goodall has spoken here. 
<Sync time="458.754"/>
So we have a wide spectrum of speakers. 
<Sync time="460.408"/>
Some of those events are larger than others, 
<Sync time="462.888"/>
but at all of our events we ask people to exchange business cards and get to know the people at their table. 
<Sync time="466.727"/>
So people always come away with 
<Sync time="468.778"/>
8 or 10 business cards from a Board of Trade event, 
<Sync time="470.712"/>
if they don't they're not networking properly.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="473.348" endTime="477.156">
<Sync time="473.348"/>
Now, I think you have also some specialized networking sessions?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="477.156" endTime="496.26">
<Sync time="477.156"/>
We have networking round tables once a month 
<Sync time="482.215"/>
where we ask people, 
<Sync time="484.108"/>
in half-hour periods, 
<Sync time="485.784"/>
to meet people at their table, 
<Sync time="487.112"/>
hand out business cards and 
<Sync time="488.174"/>
say what it is they do and they're interested in. 
<Sync time="490.778"/>
And then we switch to another table and then another 
<Sync time="493.120"/>
so they get to meet 3 groups of people.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="496.26" endTime="505.89">
<Sync time="496.26"/>
And 
<Sync time="497.365"/>
presumably your membership consists of people from all kinds of different origins, 
<Sync time="501.453"/>
recent immigrants, 
<Sync time="503.526"/>
long-established Vancouverites?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="505.89" endTime="526.997">
<Sync time="505.89"/>
Our membership is the broad cross-section of businesses in Vancouver 
<Sync time="510.359"/>
and for people who work for businesses. 
<Sync time="511.644"/>
We have individual memberships of course as well. 
<Sync time="513.61"/>
People who aren't directly engaged in business, 
<Sync time="516.142"/>
but who want to be involved with the business community join - 
<Sync time="519.831"/>
but the large companies are members, 
<Sync time="521.779"/>
but most of our members, 80 percent of our members, 
<Sync time="523.893"/>
are small businesses or individuals.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="526.997" endTime="537.859">
<Sync time="526.997"/>
And how much of an obstacle can language be if people aren't 
<Sync time="531.754"/>
completely fluent in English? 
<Sync time="532.982"/>
What degree of fluency do you need to be an effective networker?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="537.859" endTime="581.267">
<Sync time="537.859"/>
You've got to be able to carry on a normal dinner-type conversation . 
<Sync time="545.564"/>
Language is very important. 
<Sync time="548.093"/>
I wouldn't worry about accents. 
<Sync time="549.53"/>
Accents are very common here. 
<Sync time="551.564"/>
I wouldn't worry too much about 
<Sync time="555.211"/>
being perfectly grammatical 
<Sync time="556.995"/>
but it can be painful 
<Sync time="558.999"/>
when people, 
<Sync time="560.393"/>
they've got to want to be able to exchange information 
<Sync time="562.689"/>
and want to engage the listener in a meaningful way. 
<Sync time="568.483"/>
But I would think that the immigrant will know 
<Sync time="570.76"/>
when they have achieved that level 
<Sync time="572.301"/>
just by the body language they're getting back from the people they talk to. 
<Sync time="576.596"/>
And a good place to test that is at our members' reception 
<Sync time="579.516"/>
and to practice that as well.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="581.267" endTime="630.811">
<Sync time="581.267"/>
Now, once again, the members' reception that occurs just once a month, 
<Sync time="585.638"/>
but it's for any member, 
<Sync time="586.958"/>
not just the new members. 
<Sync time="587.733"/>
Anyone who wants to show up shows up. 
<Sync time="590.804"/>
I should go to that, 
<Sync time="592.205"/>
I'm a member now. I should come. 
<Sync time="599.387"/>
Any other advice that you might leave with people? 
<Sync time="603.884"/>
If you take the situation of an immigrant who has been here for 1, 2, 3 years: 
<Sync time="607.939"/>
very often they don't know many people, 
<Sync time="609.777"/>
sometimes they feel less than confident with their English. 
<Sync time="612.765"/>
Even though they may have a professional background, 
<Sync time="614.917"/>
they might be working in jobs that are 
<Sync time="616.983"/>
not so satisfactory, 
<Sync time="618.004"/>
which can be a little bit 
<Sync time="619.365"/>
soul-destroying 
<Sync time="621.311"/>
or undermining their confidence. 
<Sync time="624.087"/>
How could they use the Board of Trade 
<Sync time="625.975"/>
or networking in general 
<Sync time="627.442"/>
to integrate themselves better into this society?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="630.811" endTime="676.114">
<Sync time="630.811"/>
Come out to a lot of events. 
<Sync time="632.471"/>
Go to a lot of events in the community. 
<Sync time="634.17"/>
Get involved as a volunteer, 
<Sync time="635.722"/>
look for opportunities where they can add value to the organization. 
<Sync time="641.543"/>
If they decide to join up with Vancouver AM 
<Sync time="643.762"/>
then volunteer to take tickets in the morning. 
<Sync time="646.759"/>
You don't need a lot of language skills to do that, 
<Sync time="649.032"/>
but become known. 
<Sync time="650.473"/>
And then people talk to you and you can respond. 
<Sync time="653.387"/>
But be visible 
<Sync time="654.827"/>
and do a lot of it. 
<Sync time="656.255"/>
A good firm handshake,

looking people in the eye when they speak 
<Sync time="660.042"/>
is very, very important. 
<Sync time="661.61"/>
Showing an interest in the listener. 
<Sync time="666.694"/>
There are other things they can do to get skills. 
<Sync time="669.605"/>
Certainly Dale Carnegie 
<Sync time="671.05"/>
is a course that I highly recommend 
<Sync time="672.954"/>
that people go to and that would bolster their confidence.

Even the audio version of it 
<Sync time="678.076"/>
or do you think they should go to the course itself?

Well, either one. 
<Sync time="683.198"/>
But certainly everybody that I've put through Dale Carnegie has come back a changed person. 
<Sync time="691.354"/>
But get out there and do things as often as you can, 
<Sync time="694.021"/>
meet as many people as you can 
<Sync time="695.096"/>
and speak to people, 
<Sync time="696.264"/>
hand out your business card - 
<Sync time="697.638"/>
tell them what you do.

Well, I think we've covered the subject 
<Sync time="701.308"/>
and I appreciate you taking the time. 
<Sync time="702.685"/>
Thank you very much.
