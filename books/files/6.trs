THOUGHT AND PURPOSE
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="24.651" endTime="44.217">
<Sync time="24.651"/>
UNTIL thought is linked with purpose 
<Sync time="27.186"/>
there is no intelligent accomplishment. 
<Sync time="30.159"/>
With the majority the bark of thought is allowed to "drift" upon the ocean of life. 
<Sync time="35.375"/>
Aimlessness is a vice, 
<Sync time="37.433"/>
and such drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of catastrophe and destruction.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="44.217" endTime="69.783">
<Sync time="44.217"/>
They who have no central purpose in their life fall an easy prey 
<Sync time="47.917"/>
to petty worries, 
<Sync time="49.149"/>
fears, 
<Sync time="49.938"/>
troubles, 
<Sync time="50.72"/>
and self-pityings, 
<Sync time="52.4"/>
all of which are indications of weakness, 
<Sync time="55.283"/>
which lead, 
<Sync time="56.422"/>
just as surely as deliberately planned sins 
<Sync time="59.469"/>
(though by a different route), 
<Sync time="61.028"/>
to failure, 
<Sync time="62.183"/>
unhappiness, 
<Sync time="63.195"/>
and loss, 
<Sync time="64.571"/>
for weakness cannot persist in a power evolving universe.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="69.783" endTime="130.268">
<Sync time="69.783"/>
A man should conceive of a legitimate purpose in his heart, 
<Sync time="73.303"/>
and set out to accomplish it. 
<Sync time="75.734"/>
He should make this purpose the centralizing point of his thoughts. 
<Sync time="80.067"/>
It may take the form of a spiritual ideal, 
<Sync time="83.088"/>
or it may be a worldly object, 
<Sync time="85.041"/>
according to his nature at the time being; 
<Sync time="88.013"/>
but whichever it is, 
<Sync time="89.566"/>
he should steadily focus his thought-forces upon the object, 
<Sync time="92.947"/>
which he has set before him. 
<Sync time="95.293"/>
He should make this purpose his supreme duty, 
<Sync time="97.977"/>
and should devote himself to its attainment, 
<Sync time="100.779"/>
not allowing his thoughts to wander away into ephemeral fancies, 
<Sync time="104.884"/>
longings, 
<Sync time="105.619"/>
and imaginings. 
<Sync time="107.426"/>
This is the royal road to self-control 
<Sync time="109.79"/>
and true concentration of thought. 
<Sync time="112.373"/>
Even if he fails again and again to accomplish his purpose 
<Sync time="116.467"/>
(as he necessarily must until weakness is overcome), 
<Sync time="120.471"/>
the strength of character gained 
<Sync time="122.464"/>
will be the measure of his true success, 
<Sync time="125.279"/>
and this will form a new starting-point for future power and triumph.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="130.268" endTime="152.804">
<Sync time="130.268"/>
Those who are not prepared for the apprehension of a great purpose 
<Sync time="134.06"/>
should fix the thoughts upon the faultless performance of their duty, 
<Sync time="138.464"/>
no matter how insignificant their task may appear. 
<Sync time="142.438"/>
Only in this way can the thoughts be gathered and focussed, 
<Sync time="145.609"/>
and resolution and energy be developed, 
<Sync time="148.795"/>
which being done, 
<Sync time="149.879"/>
there is nothing which may not be accomplished.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="152.804" endTime="174.838">
<Sync time="152.804"/>
The weakest soul, 
<Sync time="154.161"/>
knowing its own weakness, 
<Sync time="155.877"/>
and believing this truth 
<Sync time="157.513"/>
that strength can only be developed by effort and practice, 
<Sync time="161.419"/>
will, thus believing, at once begin to exert itself, 
<Sync time="163.851"/>
and, adding effort to effort, 
<Sync time="165.712"/>
patience to patience, 
<Sync time="167.357"/>
and strength to strength, 
<Sync time="169.004"/>
will never cease to develop, 
<Sync time="171.009"/>
and will at last grow divinely strong.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="174.838" endTime="185.907">
<Sync time="174.838"/>
As the physically weak man can make himself strong by careful and patient training, 
<Sync time="180.039"/>
so the man of weak thoughts can make them strong by exercising himself in right thinking.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="185.907" endTime="206.065">
<Sync time="185.907"/>
To put away aimlessness and weakness, 
<Sync time="188.81"/>
and to begin to think with purpose, 
<Sync time="191.035"/>
is to enter the ranks of those strong ones who only recognize failure 
<Sync time="194.765"/>
as one of the pathways to attainment; 
<Sync time="197.427"/>
who make all conditions serve them, 
<Sync time="199.651"/>
and who think strongly, 
<Sync time="201.075"/>
attempt fearlessly, 
<Sync time="202.848"/>
and accomplish masterfully.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="206.065" endTime="242.587">
<Sync time="206.065"/>
Having conceived of his purpose, 
<Sync time="208.146"/>
a man should mentally mark out a straight pathway to its achievement, 
<Sync time="212.153"/>
looking neither to the right nor the left. 
<Sync time="215.466"/>
Doubts and fears should be rigorously excluded; 
<Sync time="219.162"/>
they are disintegrating elements, 
<Sync time="221.256"/>
which break up the straight line of effort, 
<Sync time="223.925"/>
rendering it crooked, 
<Sync time="225.398"/>
ineffectual, 
<Sync time="226.664"/>
useless. 
<Sync time="228.373"/>
Thoughts of doubt and fear never accomplished anything, 
<Sync time="231.347"/>
and never can. 
<Sync time="232.919"/>
They always lead to failure. 
<Sync time="235.164"/>
Purpose, 
<Sync time="236.048"/>
energy, 
<Sync time="236.944"/>
power to do, 
<Sync time="238.168"/>
and all strong thoughts cease 
<Sync time="239.951"/>
when doubt and fear creep in.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="242.587" endTime="256.546">
<Sync time="242.587"/>
The will to do springs from the knowledge that we can do. 
<Sync time="246.743"/>
Doubt and fear are the great enemies of knowledge, 
<Sync time="249.619"/>
and he who encourages them, 
<Sync time="251.489"/>
who does not slay them, 
<Sync time="253.319"/>
thwarts himself at every step.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="256.546" endTime="275.212">
<Sync time="256.546"/>
He who has conquered doubt and fear has conquered failure. 
<Sync time="259.927"/>
His every thought is allied with power, 
<Sync time="262.605"/>
and all difficulties are bravely met 
<Sync time="265.049"/>
and wisely overcome. 
<Sync time="266.924"/>
His purposes are seasonably planted, 
<Sync time="269.718"/>
and they bloom and bring forth fruit, 
<Sync time="271.674"/>
which does not fall prematurely to the ground.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="275.212" endTime="302.973968254">
<Sync time="275.212"/>
Thought allied fearlessly to purpose becomes creative force: 
<Sync time="279.801"/>
he who knows this 
<Sync time="281.898"/>
is ready to become something higher 
<Sync time="283.953"/>
and stronger than a mere bundle of wavering thoughts 
<Sync time="287.125"/>
and fluctuating sensations; 
<Sync time="289.593"/>
he who does this 
<Sync time="290.991"/>
has become the conscious 
<Sync time="292.369"/>
and intelligent wielder 
<Sync time="293.736"/>
of his mental powers.
<Sync time="295.382"/>
