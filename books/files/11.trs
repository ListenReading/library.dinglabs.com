THE POOL OF TEARS
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="25.172" endTime="47.968">
<Sync time="25.172"/>
"Curiouser and curiouser!" cried Alice 
<Sync time="28.531"/>
(she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English). 
<Sync time="33.828"/>
"Now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! 
<Sync time="37.75"/>
Good-by, feet! 
<Sync time="38.968"/>
Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? 
<Sync time="43.686"/>
I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="47.968" endTime="60.141">
<Sync time="47.968"/>
Just at this moment 
<Sync time="49.344"/>
her head struck against the roof of the hall; 
<Sync time="51.968"/>
in fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, 
<Sync time="55.5"/>
and she at once took up 
<Sync time="56.875"/>
the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="60.141" endTime="72.063">
<Sync time="60.141"/>
Poor Alice! 
<Sync time="61.14"/>
It was as much as she could do, 
<Sync time="62.515"/>
lying down on one side, 
<Sync time="63.952"/>
to look through into the garden with one eye; 
<Sync time="66.452"/>
but to get through was more hopeless than ever. 
<Sync time="68.765"/>
She sat down and began to cry again.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="72.063" endTime="78.909">
<Sync time="72.063"/>
She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all 'round her 
<Sync time="76.581"/>
and reaching half down the hall.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="78.909" endTime="103.19">
<Sync time="78.909"/>
After a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance 
<Sync time="82.269"/>
and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. 
<Sync time="85.518"/>
It was the White Rabbit 
<Sync time="87.034"/>
returning, 
<Sync time="87.612"/>
splendidly dressed, 
<Sync time="88.925"/>
with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand 
<Sync time="91.409"/>
and a large fan in the other. 
<Sync time="93.534"/>
He came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, 
<Sync time="96.986"/>
"Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! 
<Sync time="99.08"/>
Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="103.19" endTime="117.232">
<Sync time="103.19"/>
When the Rabbit came near her, 
<Sync time="104.909"/>
Alice began, 
<Sync time="105.94"/>
in a low, timid voice, 
<Sync time="107.815"/>
"If you please, sir—" 
<Sync time="109.862"/>
The Rabbit started violently, 
<Sync time="111.894"/>
dropped the white kid-gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="117.232" endTime="117.685">
<Sync time="117.232"/>

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="117.685" endTime="137.657">
<Sync time="117.685"/>
Alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking. 
<Sync time="123.127"/>
"Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! 
<Sync time="125.861"/>
And yesterday things went on just as usual. 
<Sync time="128.345"/>
Was I the same when I got up this morning? 
<Sync time="131.111"/>
But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 
<Sync time="133.47"/>
'Who in the world am I?' 
<Sync time="135.329"/>
Ah, that's the great puzzle!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="137.657" endTime="168.016">
<Sync time="137.657"/>
As she said this, 
<Sync time="139.001"/>
she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid-gloves while she was talking. 
<Sync time="145.813"/>
"How can I have done that?" she thought. 
<Sync time="147.954"/>
"I must be growing small again." 
<Sync time="150.297"/>
She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it 
<Sync time="153.266"/>
and found that she was now about two feet high 
<Sync time="155.844"/>
and was going on shrinking rapidly. 
<Sync time="158.452"/>
She soon found out 
<Sync time="160.093"/>
that the cause of this 
<Sync time="161.343"/>
was the fan she was holding 
<Sync time="162.922"/>
and she dropped it hastily, just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="168.016" endTime="193.109">
<Sync time="168.016"/>
"That was a narrow escape!" said Alice, 
<Sync time="170.218"/>
a good deal frightened at the sudden change, 
<Sync time="172.593"/>
but very glad to find herself still in existence. 
<Sync time="175.64"/>
"And now for the garden!" 
<Sync time="177.406"/>
And she ran with all speed back to the little door; 
<Sync time="180.5"/>
but, alas! the little door was shut again 
<Sync time="183.03"/>
and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before. 
<Sync time="187.015"/>
"Things are worse than ever," thought the poor child, 
<Sync time="189.499"/>
"for I never was so small as this before, 
<Sync time="191.687"/>
never!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="193.109" endTime="209.492">
<Sync time="193.109"/>
As she said these words, 
<Sync time="194.546"/>
her foot slipped, 
<Sync time="195.671"/>
and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. 
<Sync time="200.063"/>
Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea. 
<Sync time="203.719"/>
However, 
<Sync time="204.516"/>
she soon made out 
<Sync time="205.5"/>
that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="209.492" endTime="210.141">
<Sync time="209.492"/>
i006_th.jpg
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="210.141" endTime="222.406">
<Sync time="210.141"/>
Just then 
<Sync time="211.141"/>
she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, 
<Sync time="214.719"/>
and she swam nearer to see what it was: 
<Sync time="217.188"/>
she soon made out 
<Sync time="218.36"/>
that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="222.406" endTime="248.78">
<Sync time="222.406"/>
"Would it be of any use, now," thought Alice, "to speak to this mouse? 
<Sync time="226.141"/>
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here that I should think very likely it can talk; 
<Sync time="230.657"/>
at any rate, there's no harm in trying." 
<Sync time="233.047"/>
So she began, 
<Sync time="234.218"/>
"O Mouse, 
<Sync time="235.327"/>
do you know the way out of this pool? 
<Sync time="237.186"/>
I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!" 
<Sync time="241.014"/>
The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively 
<Sync time="243.514"/>
and seemed to her to wink 
<Sync time="244.873"/>
with one of its little eyes, 
<Sync time="246.436"/>
but it said nothing.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="248.78" endTime="273.577">
<Sync time="248.78"/>
"Perhaps it doesn't understand English," 
<Sync time="250.842"/>
thought Alice. 
<Sync time="251.733"/>
"I dare say it's a French mouse, 
<Sync time="253.514"/>
come over with William the Conqueror." 
<Sync time="255.748"/>
So she began again: 
<Sync time="257.561"/>
"Où est ma chatte?" 
<Sync time="258.67"/>
which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. 
<Sync time="261.623"/>
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. 
<Sync time="266.045"/>
"Oh, I beg your pardon!" cried Alice hastily, 
<Sync time="268.421"/>
afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. 
<Sync time="270.858"/>
"I quite forgot you didn't like cats."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="273.577" endTime="280.516">
<Sync time="273.577"/>
"Not like cats!" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. 
<Sync time="277.828"/>
"Would you like cats, if you were me?"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="280.516" endTime="300.782">
<Sync time="280.516"/>
"Well, perhaps not," said Alice in a soothing tone; 
<Sync time="283.455"/>
"don't be angry about it. 
<Sync time="285.002"/>
And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. 
<Sync time="287.471"/>
I think you'd take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. 
<Sync time="290.33"/>
She is such a dear, quiet thing." 
<Sync time="292.658"/>
The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended. 
<Sync time="297.392"/>
"We won't talk about her any more, 
<Sync time="298.969"/>
if you'd rather not."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="300.782" endTime="313.364">
<Sync time="300.782"/>
"We, indeed!" 
<Sync time="302.032"/>
cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of its tail. 
<Sync time="305.281"/>
"As if I would talk on such a subject! 
<Sync time="307.782"/>
Our family always hated cats—
<Sync time="310.015"/>
nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="313.364" endTime="313.985">
<Sync time="313.364"/>
plate02_th.jpg
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="313.985" endTime="340.391">
<Sync time="313.985"/>
"I won't indeed!" said Alice, 
<Sync time="315.891"/>
in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. 
<Sync time="319.266"/>
"Are you—
<Sync time="320.36"/>
are you fond—of—
<Sync time="322.11"/>
of dogs? 
<Sync time="323.595"/>
There is such a nice little dog near our house, 
<Sync time="325.891"/>
I should like to show you! 
<Sync time="327.126"/>
It kills all the rats and—
<Sync time="328.969"/>
oh, dear!" 
<Sync time="329.765"/>
cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. 
<Sync time="331.625"/>
"I'm afraid I've offended it again!" 
<Sync time="333.812"/>
For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, 
<Sync time="336.859"/>
and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="340.391" endTime="362.935">
<Sync time="340.391"/>
So she called softly after it, 
<Sync time="342.421"/>
"Mouse dear! Do come back again, 
<Sync time="344.358"/>
and we won't talk about cats, or dogs either, if you don't like them!" 
<Sync time="348.202"/>
When the Mouse heard this, 
<Sync time="349.623"/>
it turned 'round and swam slowly back to her; 
<Sync time="352.545"/>
its face was quite pale, and it said, in a low, trembling voice, 
<Sync time="356.201"/>
"Let us get to the shore 
<Sync time="357.748"/>
and then I'll tell you my history 
<Sync time="359.295"/>
and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="362.935" endTime="379.657">
<Sync time="362.935"/>
It was high time to go, 
<Sync time="365.123"/>
for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it; 
<Sync time="369.576"/>
there were a Duck and a Dodo, 
<Sync time="371.608"/>
a Lory and an Eaglet, 
<Sync time="373.171"/>
and several other curious creatures. 
<Sync time="375.718"/>
Alice led the way 
<Sync time="377.187"/>
and the whole party swam to the shore.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="379.657" endTime="386.638">
