THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="26.425" endTime="62.94">
<Sync time="26.425"/>
Many years ago, there was an Emperor, 
<Sync time="28.912"/>
who was so excessively fond of new clothes, 
<Sync time="32.026"/>
that he spent all his money in dress. 
<Sync time="35.069"/>
He did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers; 
<Sync time="38.387"/>
nor did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase, 
<Sync time="41.855"/>
except for the opportunities then afforded him 
<Sync time="44.601"/>
for displaying his new clothes. 
<Sync time="47.178"/>
He had a different suit for each hour of the day; 
<Sync time="50.043"/>
and 
<Sync time="50.681"/>
as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say, 
<Sync time="54.417"/>
"he is sitting in council," 
<Sync time="56.652"/>
it was always said of him, 
<Sync time="58.655"/>
"The Emperor is sitting in his wardrobe."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="62.94" endTime="94.422">
<Sync time="62.94"/>
Time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; 
<Sync time="66.771"/>
strangers arrived every day at the court. 
<Sync time="69.56"/>
One day, two rogues, 
<Sync time="71.376"/>
calling themselves weavers, 
<Sync time="73.197"/>
made their appearance. 
<Sync time="74.634"/>
They gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most 
<Sync time="78.184"/>
beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, 
<Sync time="81.37"/>
the clothes manufactured from which 
<Sync time="83.53"/>
should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held, 
<Sync time="89.921"/>
or who was extraordinarily simple in character.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="94.422" endTime="120.583">
<Sync time="94.422"/>
"These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!" 
<Sync time="97.196"/>
thought the Emperor. 
<Sync time="98.904"/>
"Had I such a suit, 
<Sync time="100.313"/>
I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit for their office, 
<Sync time="105.412"/>
and also be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish! 
<Sync time="109.069"/>
This stuff must be woven for me immediately." 
<Sync time="112.499"/>
And he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers 
<Sync time="116.611"/>
in order that they might begin their work directly.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="120.583" endTime="142.374">
<Sync time="120.583"/>
So the two pretended weavers set up two looms, 
<Sync time="124.065"/>
and affected to work very busily, 
<Sync time="126.41"/>
though in reality they did nothing at all. 
<Sync time="129.273"/>
They asked for the most delicate silk 
<Sync time="131.709"/>
and the purest gold thread; 
<Sync time="134.032"/>
put both into their own knapsacks; 
<Sync time="136.642"/>
and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms 
<Sync time="140.169"/>
until late at night.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="142.374" endTime="186.934">
<Sync time="142.374"/>
"I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth," 
<Sync time="145.679"/>
said the Emperor to himself, 
<Sync time="147.703"/>
after some little time had elapsed; 
<Sync time="150.748"/>
he was, however, rather embarrassed, 
<Sync time="153.079"/>
when he remembered that a simpleton, 
<Sync time="155.019"/>
or one unfit for his office, 
<Sync time="157.084"/>
would be unable to see the manufacture. 
<Sync time="159.795"/>
To be sure, 
<Sync time="160.928"/>
he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person; 
<Sync time="163.943"/>
but yet, 
<Sync time="165.006"/>
he would prefer sending somebody else, 
<Sync time="167.488"/>
to bring him intelligence about the weavers, and their work, 
<Sync time="170.61"/>
before he troubled himself in the affair. 
<Sync time="173.678"/>
All the people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to possess; 
<Sync time="179.449"/>
and all were anxious to learn how wise, 
<Sync time="182.119"/>
or how ignorant, 
<Sync time="183.488"/>
their neighbors might prove to be.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="186.934" endTime="203.78">
<Sync time="186.934"/>
"I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers," 
<Sync time="190.203"/>
said the Emperor at last, 
<Sync time="191.774"/>
after some deliberation, 
<Sync time="193.969"/>
"he will be best able to see how the cloth looks; 
<Sync time="197.002"/>
for he is a man of sense, 
<Sync time="198.691"/>
and no one can be more suitable for his office than he is."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="203.78" endTime="227.685">
<Sync time="203.78"/>
So the faithful old minister went into the hall, 
<Sync time="206.973"/>
where the knaves were working with all their might, 
<Sync time="209.19"/>
at their empty looms. 
<Sync time="211.616"/>
"What can be the meaning of this?" 
<Sync time="213.944"/>
thought the old man, 
<Sync time="215.496"/>
opening his eyes very wide. 
<Sync time="218.28"/>
"I cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms." 
<Sync time="222.973"/>
However, he did not express his thoughts aloud.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="227.685" endTime="274.597">
<Sync time="227.685"/>
The impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms; 
<Sync time="233.344"/>
and then asked him whether the design pleased him, 
<Sync time="236.524"/>
and whether the colors were not very beautiful; 
<Sync time="239.265"/>
at the same time pointing to the empty frames. 
<Sync time="243.164"/>
The poor old minister looked and looked, 
<Sync time="245.719"/>
he could not discover anything on the looms, 
<Sync time="248.083"/>
for a very good reason, 
<Sync time="249.847"/>
viz: 
<Sync time="250.667"/>
there was nothing there. 
<Sync time="253.485"/>
"What!" 
<Sync time="254.623"/>
thought he again. 
<Sync time="256.367"/>
"Is it possible that I am a simpleton? 
<Sync time="259.484"/>
I have never thought so myself; 
<Sync time="261.543"/>
and no one must know it now if I am so. 
<Sync time="264.741"/>
Can it be, that I am unfit for my office? 
<Sync time="268.03"/>
No, that must not be said either. 
<Sync time="270.549"/>
I will never confess that I could not see the stuff."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="274.597" endTime="283.465">
<Sync time="274.597"/>
"Well, Sir Minister!" 
<Sync time="276.609"/>
said one of the knaves, 
<Sync time="277.895"/>
still pretending to work. 
<Sync time="279.763"/>
"You do not say whether the stuff pleases you."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="283.465" endTime="298.747">
<Sync time="283.465"/>
"Oh, it is excellent!" 
<Sync time="285.471"/>
replied the old minister, 
<Sync time="287.162"/>
looking at the loom through his spectacles. 
<Sync time="289.856"/>
"This pattern, 
<Sync time="291.129"/>
and the colors, 
<Sync time="292.355"/>
yes, 
<Sync time="292.967"/>
I will tell the Emperor without delay, 
<Sync time="295.049"/>
how very beautiful I think them."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="298.747" endTime="335.12">
<Sync time="298.747"/>
"We shall be much obliged to you," 
<Sync time="301.03"/>
said the impostors, 
<Sync time="302.506"/>
and then they named the different colors 
<Sync time="305.272"/>
and described the pattern of the pretended stuff. 
<Sync time="309.602"/>
The old minister listened attentively to their words, 
<Sync time="312.591"/>
in order that he might repeat them to the Emperor; 
<Sync time="315.432"/>
and then the knaves asked for more silk and gold, 
<Sync time="319.33"/>
saying that it was necessary to complete what they had begun. 
<Sync time="323.268"/>
However, 
<Sync time="324.13"/>
they put all that was given them into their knapsacks; 
<Sync time="327.522"/>
and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as before 
<Sync time="331.877"/>
at their empty looms.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="335.12" endTime="354.892">
<Sync time="335.12"/>
The Emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men were getting on, 
<Sync time="339.778"/>
and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready. 
<Sync time="344.04"/>
It was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister; 
<Sync time="347.687"/>
he surveyed the looms on all sides, 
<Sync time="350.254"/>
but could see nothing at all but the empty frames.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="354.892" endTime="372.776">
<Sync time="354.892"/>
"Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you, as it did to my lord the minister?" 
<Sync time="360.097"/>
asked the impostors of the Emperor's second ambassador; 
<Sync time="364.402"/>
at the same time making the same gestures as before, 
<Sync time="367.436"/>
and talking of the design and colors 
<Sync time="369.973"/>
which were not there.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="372.776" endTime="408.332">
<Sync time="372.776"/>
"I certainly am not stupid!" 
<Sync time="375.005"/>
thought the messenger. 
<Sync time="376.964"/>
"It must be, that I am not fit for my good, profitable office! 
<Sync time="381.16"/>
That is very odd; 
<Sync time="382.421"/>
however, 
<Sync time="383.357"/>
no one shall know anything about it." 
<Sync time="386.39"/>
And accordingly he praised the stuff he could not see, 
<Sync time="390.112"/>
and declared that he was delighted with both colors and patterns. 
<Sync time="395.701"/>
"Indeed, 
<Sync time="396.756"/>
please your Imperial Majesty," 
<Sync time="398.861"/>
said he to his sovereign when he returned, 
<Sync time="402.264"/>
"the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magnificent."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="408.332" endTime="416.086">
<Sync time="408.332"/>
The whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the Emperor had ordered to be woven at his own expense.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="416.086" endTime="446.406">
<Sync time="416.086"/>
And now the Emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture, 
<Sync time="421.023"/>
while it was still in the loom. 
<Sync time="423.572"/>
Accompanied by a select number of officers of the court, 
<Sync time="427.505"/>
among whom 
<Sync time="428.508"/>
were the two honest men who had already admired the cloth, 
<Sync time="431.72"/>
he went to the crafty impostors, who, 
<Sync time="434.259"/>
as soon as they were aware of the Emperor's approach, 
<Sync time="437.122"/>
went on working more diligently than ever; 
<Sync time="440.516"/>
although they still did not pass a single thread 
<Sync time="444.067"/>
through the looms.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="446.406" endTime="470.041">
<Sync time="446.406"/>
"Is not the work absolutely magnificent?" 
<Sync time="449.372"/>
said the two officers of the crown, already mentioned. 
<Sync time="453.101"/>
"If your Majesty will only be pleased to look at it! 
<Sync time="456.458"/>
What a splendid design! 
<Sync time="458.032"/>
What glorious colors!" 
<Sync time="460.496"/>
and at the same time they pointed to the empty frames; 
<Sync time="463.989"/>
for they imagined that everyone else could see 
<Sync time="466.8"/>
this exquisite piece of workmanship.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="470.041" endTime="553.366">
<Sync time="470.041"/>
"How is this?" 
<Sync time="471.679"/>
said the Emperor to himself. 
<Sync time="473.923"/>
"I can see nothing! 
<Sync time="475.913"/>
This is indeed a terrible affair! 
<Sync time="478.711"/>
Am I a simpleton, 
<Sync time="480.207"/>
or am I unfit to be an Emperor? 
<Sync time="483.16"/>
That would be the worst thing that could happen—
<Sync time="486.073"/>
Oh! 
<Sync time="487.044"/>
the cloth is charming," 
<Sync time="489.227"/>
said he, aloud. 
<Sync time="490.71"/>
"It has my complete approbation." 
<Sync time="494.298"/>
And he smiled most graciously, 
<Sync time="496.831"/>
and looked closely at the empty looms; 
<Sync time="499.591"/>
for on no account would he say that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much. 
<Sync time="507.034"/>
All his retinue now strained their eyes, 
<Sync time="510.12"/>
hoping to discover something on the looms, 
<Sync time="512.973"/>
but they could see no more than the others; 
<Sync time="515.772"/>
nevertheless, they all exclaimed, 
<Sync time="518.156"/>
"Oh, how beautiful!" 
<Sync time="521.436"/>
and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material, 
<Sync time="526.482"/>
for the approaching procession. 
<Sync time="529.327"/>
"Magnificent! 
<Sync time="530.858"/>
Charming! 
<Sync time="531.988"/>
Excellent!" 
<Sync time="533.461"/>
resounded on all sides; 
<Sync time="535.828"/>
and everyone was uncommonly gay. 
<Sync time="539.443"/>
The Emperor shared in the general satisfaction; 
<Sync time="542.415"/>
and presented the impostors with the riband 
<Sync time="545.273"/>
of an order of knighthood, 
<Sync time="547.049"/>
to be worn in their button-holes, 
<Sync time="548.928"/>
and the title of 
<Sync time="550.471"/>
"Gentlemen Weavers."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="553.366" endTime="584.503">
<Sync time="553.366"/>
The rogues 
<Sync time="554.527"/>
sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place, 
<Sync time="559.598"/>
and had sixteen lights burning, 
<Sync time="562.346"/>
so that everyone might see how anxious they were to finish the Emperor's new suit. 
<Sync time="567.961"/>
They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms; 
<Sync time="571.316"/>
cut the air with their scissors; 
<Sync time="573.402"/>
and sewed with needles without any thread in them. 
<Sync time="577.084"/>
"See!" 
<Sync time="578.307"/>
cried they, at last. 
<Sync time="579.986"/>
"The Emperor's new clothes 
<Sync time="582.082"/>
are ready!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="584.503" endTime="617.147">
<Sync time="584.503"/>
And now the Emperor, 
<Sync time="586.404"/>
with all the grandees of his court, 
<Sync time="588.637"/>
came to the weavers; 
<Sync time="590.079"/>
and the rogues raised their arms, 
<Sync time="592.795"/>
as if in the act of holding something up,
<Sync time="595.183"/>
 saying, 
<Sync time="596.402"/>
"Here are your Majesty's trousers! 
<Sync time="599.197"/>
Here is the scarf! 
<Sync time="601.132"/>
Here is the mantle! 
<Sync time="602.967"/>
The whole suit is as light as a cobweb; 
<Sync time="606.738"/>
one might fancy one has nothing at all on, 
<Sync time="609.586"/>
when dressed in it; 
<Sync time="611.131"/>
that, 
<Sync time="611.806"/>
however, 
<Sync time="612.464"/>
is the great virtue 
<Sync time="613.653"/>
of this delicate cloth."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="617.147" endTime="626.868">
<Sync time="617.147"/>
"Yes indeed!" 
<Sync time="618.602"/>
said all the courtiers, 
<Sync time="620.163"/>
although not one of them could see anything of this exquisite manufacture.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="626.868" endTime="636.908">
<Sync time="626.868"/>
"If your Imperial Majesty will be graciously pleased 
<Sync time="630.58"/>
to take off your clothes, 
<Sync time="632.072"/>
we will fit on the new suit, 
<Sync time="633.905"/>
in front of the looking glass."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="636.908" endTime="648.557">
<Sync time="636.908"/>
The Emperor was accordingly undressed, 
<Sync time="639.36"/>
and the rogues pretended to array him in his new suit; 
<Sync time="643.334"/>
the Emperor turning round, 
<Sync time="644.913"/>
from side to side, 
<Sync time="646.126"/>
before the looking glass.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="648.557" endTime="664.389">
<Sync time="648.557"/>
"How splendid his Majesty looks in his new clothes, 
<Sync time="652.585"/>
and how well they fit!" 
<Sync time="655.121"/>
everyone cried out. 
<Sync time="657.171"/>
"What a design! 
<Sync time="658.614"/>
What colors! 
<Sync time="659.933"/>
These are indeed royal robes!"
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="664.389" endTime="672.628">
<Sync time="664.389"/>
"The canopy which is to be borne over your Majesty, in the procession, 
<Sync time="667.877"/>
is waiting," 
<Sync time="669.067"/>
announced the chief master of the ceremonies.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="672.628" endTime="687.977">
<Sync time="672.628"/>
"I am quite ready," 
<Sync time="674.202"/>
answered the Emperor. 
<Sync time="675.799"/>
"Do my new clothes fit well?" 
<Sync time="678.057"/>
asked he, 
<Sync time="679.427"/>
turning himself round again before the looking glass, 
<Sync time="682.266"/>
in order that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="687.977" endTime="706.577">
<Sync time="687.977"/>
The lords of the bedchamber, 
<Sync time="689.743"/>
who were to carry his Majesty's train felt about on the ground, 
<Sync time="693.311"/>
as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle; 
<Sync time="696.248"/>
and pretended to be carrying something; 
<Sync time="698.738"/>
for they would by no means betray anything like simplicity, 
<Sync time="702.677"/>
or unfitness for their office.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="706.577" endTime="751.123">
<Sync time="706.577"/>
So now the Emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the procession, 
<Sync time="711.781"/>
through the streets of his capital; 
<Sync time="713.834"/>
and all the people standing by, 
<Sync time="716.196"/>
and those at the windows, cried out, 
<Sync time="718.796"/>
"Oh! How beautiful are our Emperor's new clothes! 
<Sync time="723.479"/>
What a magnificent train there is to the mantle; 
<Sync time="726.483"/>
and how gracefully the scarf hangs!" 
<Sync time="729.512"/>
in short, 
<Sync time="730.696"/>
no one would allow that he could not see these much-admired clothes; 
<Sync time="735.455"/>
because, in doing so, 
<Sync time="736.936"/>
he would have declared himself 
<Sync time="738.492"/>
either a simpleton 
<Sync time="739.617"/>
or unfit for his office. 
<Sync time="742.388"/>
Certainly, 
<Sync time="743.106"/>
none of the Emperor's various suits, 
<Sync time="745.264"/>
had ever made so great an impression, 
<Sync time="747.616"/>
as these invisible ones.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="751.123" endTime="757.443">
<Sync time="751.123"/>
"But 
<Sync time="751.767"/>
the Emperor has nothing at all on!" 
<Sync time="755.082"/>
said a little child.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="757.443" endTime="766.899">
<Sync time="757.443"/>
"Listen to the voice of innocence!" 
<Sync time="759.396"/>
exclaimed his father; 
<Sync time="761.075"/>
and what the child had said was whispered from one to another.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="766.899" endTime="794.17">
<Sync time="766.899"/>
"But 
<Sync time="767.884"/>
he has nothing at all on!" 
<Sync time="770.068"/>
at last cried out all the people. 
<Sync time="773.464"/>
The Emperor was vexed, 
<Sync time="775.076"/>
for he knew that the people were right; 
<Sync time="777.621"/>
but he thought the procession must go on now! 
<Sync time="780.922"/>
And the lords of the bedchamber took greater pains than ever, 
<Sync time="784.809"/>
